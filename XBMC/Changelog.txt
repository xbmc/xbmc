                      to the previous overlays method, except it uses mplayers builtin YV12->YUY2 fast convertor.
                      Further info will be available later today in the thread:
                        http://www.xboxmediaplayer.de/cgi-bin/forums/ikonboard.pl?;act=ST;f=3;t=3916

                      Known Issues: 1080i may not be 100% in terms of Aspect ratio - it hasn't been tested
                                    Renderers cannot be switched on the fly - change will take effect at
                                    next movie play.
                                    Overlays method is much slower than the pixel shader method - reason is
                                    mostly to do with the software YV12->YUY2 conversion done by mplayer.
