 - 11-01-2005 added: Third rendering method using overlays.  Added purely to help find the reason behind the
                     quality improvements gained from the previous overlay method.  This new method is identical
                     to the previous overlays method, except it uses mplayers builtin YV12->YUY2 fast convertor.
                     Further info will be available later today in the thread:
                       http://www.xboxmediaplayer.de/cgi-bin/forums/ikonboard.pl?;act=ST;f=3;t=3916

 - 10-01-2005 added: Second rendering method using overlays.
                     Renderers can be switched from the GUI (Video Settings->Filters)
                     Known Issues: 1080i may not be 100% in terms of Aspect ratio - it hasn't been tested
                                   Renderers cannot be switched on the fly - change will take effect at
                                   next movie play.
                                   Overlays method is much slower than the pixel shader method - reason is
                                   mostly to do with the software YV12->YUY2 conversion done by mplayer.
