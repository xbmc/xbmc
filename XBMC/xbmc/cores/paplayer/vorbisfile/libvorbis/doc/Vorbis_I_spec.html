</p></div></div></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id311592"></a>1.1. Overview</h3></div></div></div><p>
This document provides a high level description of the Vorbis codec's
construction.  A bit-by-bit specification appears beginning in 
<a href="#vorbis-spec-codec" title="4. Codec Setup and Packet Decode">Section 4, &#8220;Codec Setup and Packet Decode&#8221;</a>.
The later sections assume a high-level
understanding of the Vorbis decode process, which is 
provided here.</p><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="id317198"></a>1.1.1. Application</h4></div></div></div><p>
Vorbis is a general purpose perceptual audio CODEC intended to allow
maximum encoder flexibility, thus allowing it to scale competitively
over an exceptionally wide range of bitrates.  At the high
quality/bitrate end of the scale (CD or DAT rate stereo, 16/24 bits)
it is in the same league as MPEG-2 and MPC.  Similarly, the 1.0
encoder can encode high-quality CD and DAT rate stereo at below 48kbps
without resampling to a lower rate.  Vorbis is also intended for
lower and higher sample rates (from 8kHz telephony to 192kHz digital
masters) and a range of channel representations (monaural,
polyphonic, stereo, quadraphonic, 5.1, ambisonic, or up to 255
discrete channels).
</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="id315630"></a>1.1.2. Classification</h4></div></div></div><p>
Vorbis I is a forward-adaptive monolithic transform CODEC based on the
Modified Discrete Cosine Transform.  The codec is structured to allow
addition of a hybrid wavelet filterbank in Vorbis II to offer better
transient response and reproduction using a transform better suited to
localized time events.
</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="id323943"></a>1.1.3. Assumptions</h4></div></div></div><p>
The Vorbis CODEC design assumes a complex, psychoacoustically-aware
encoder and simple, low-complexity decoder. Vorbis decode is
computationally simpler than mp3, although it does require more
working memory as Vorbis has no static probability model; the vector
codebooks used in the first stage of decoding from the bitstream are
packed in their entirety into the Vorbis bitstream headers. In
packed form, these codebooks occupy only a few kilobytes; the extent
to which they are pre-decoded into a cache is the dominant factor in
decoder memory usage.
</p><p>
Vorbis provides none of its own framing, synchronization or protection
against errors; it is solely a method of accepting input audio,
dividing it into individual frames and compressing these frames into
raw, unformatted 'packets'. The decoder then accepts these raw
packets in sequence, decodes them, synthesizes audio frames from
them, and reassembles the frames into a facsimile of the original
audio stream. Vorbis is a free-form variable bit rate (VBR) codec and packets have no
minimum size, maximum size, or fixed/expected size.  Packets
are designed that they may be truncated (or padded) and remain
decodable; this is not to be considered an error condition and is used
extensively in bitrate management in peeling.  Both the transport
mechanism and decoder must allow that a packet may be any size, or
end before or after packet decode expects.</p><p>
Vorbis packets are thus intended to be used with a transport mechanism
that provides free-form framing, sync, positioning and error correction
in accordance with these design assumptions, such as Ogg (for file
transport) or RTP (for network multicast).  For purposes of a few
examples in this document, we will assume that Vorbis is to be
embedded in an Ogg stream specifically, although this is by no means a
requirement or fundamental assumption in the Vorbis design.</p><p>
The specification for embedding Vorbis into
an Ogg transport stream is in <a href="#vorbis-over-ogg" title="1. Embedding Vorbis into an Ogg stream">Appendix 1, <i>Embedding Vorbis into an Ogg stream</i></a>.
</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="id324282"></a>1.1.4. Codec Setup and Probability Model</h4></div></div></div><p>
Vorbis' heritage is as a research CODEC and its current design
reflects a desire to allow multiple decades of continuous encoder
improvement before running out of room within the codec specification.
For these reasons, configurable aspects of codec setup intentionally
lean toward the extreme of forward adaptive.</p><p>
The single most controversial design decision in Vorbis (and the most
unusual for a Vorbis developer to keep in mind) is that the entire
probability model of the codec, the Huffman and VQ codebooks, is
packed into the bitstream header along with extensive CODEC setup
parameters (often several hundred fields).  This makes it impossible,
as it would be with MPEG audio layers, to embed a simple frame type
flag in each audio packet, or begin decode at any frame in the stream
without having previously fetched the codec setup header.
</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>
Vorbis <span class="emphasis"><em>can</em></span> initiate decode at any arbitrary packet within a
bitstream so long as the codec has been initialized/setup with the
setup headers.</p></div><p>
Thus, Vorbis headers are both required for decode to begin and
relatively large as bitstream headers go.  The header size is
unbounded, although for streaming a rule-of-thumb of 4kB or less is
recommended (and Xiph.Org's Vorbis encoder follows this suggestion).</p><p>
Our own design work indicates the primary liability of the
required header is in mindshare; it is an unusual design and thus
causes some amount of complaint among engineers as this runs against
current design trends (and also points out limitations in some
existing software/interface designs, such as Windows' ACM codec
framework).  However, we find that it does not fundamentally limit
Vorbis' suitable application space.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="id258744"></a>1.1.5. Format Specification</h4></div></div></div><p>
The Vorbis format is well-defined by its decode specification; any
encoder that produces packets that are correctly decoded by the
reference Vorbis decoder described below may be considered a proper
Vorbis encoder.  A decoder must faithfully and completely implement
the specification defined below (except where noted) to be considered
a proper Vorbis decoder.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="id258756"></a>1.1.6. Hardware Profile</h4></div></div></div><p>
Although Vorbis decode is computationally simple, it may still run
into specific limitations of an embedded design.  For this reason,
embedded designs are allowed to deviate in limited ways from the
'full' decode specification yet still be certified compliant.  These
optional omissions are labelled in the spec where relevant.</p></div></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id258770"></a>1.2. Decoder Configuration</h3></div></div></div><p>
Decoder setup consists of configuration of multiple, self-contained
component abstractions that perform specific functions in the decode
pipeline.  Each different component instance of a specific type is
semantically interchangeable; decoder configuration consists both of
internal component configuration, as well as arrangement of specific
instances into a decode pipeline.  Componentry arrangement is roughly
as follows:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="components.png" alt="decoder pipeline configuration"></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="id258803"></a>1.2.1. Global Config</h4></div></div></div><p>
Global codec configuration consists of a few audio related fields
(sample rate, channels), Vorbis version (always '0' in Vorbis I),
bitrate hints, and the lists of component instances.  All other
configuration is in the context of specific components.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="id258815"></a>1.2.2. Mode</h4></div></div></div><p>
Each Vorbis frame is coded according to a master 'mode'.  A bitstream
may use one or many modes.</p><p>
The mode mechanism is used to encode a frame according to one of
multiple possible methods with the intention of choosing a method best
suited to that frame.  Different modes are, e.g. how frame size
is changed from frame to frame. The mode number of a frame serves as a
top level configuration switch for all other specific aspects of frame
decode.</p><p>
A 'mode' configuration consists of a frame size setting, window type
(always 0, the Vorbis window, in Vorbis I), transform type (always
type 0, the MDCT, in Vorbis I) and a mapping number.  The mapping
number specifies which mapping configuration instance to use for
low-level packet decode and synthesis.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="id258359"></a>1.2.3. Mapping</h4></div></div></div><p>
A mapping contains a channel coupling description and a list of
'submaps' that bundle sets of channel vectors together for grouped
encoding and decoding. These submaps are not references to external
components; the submap list is internal and specific to a mapping.</p><p>
A 'submap' is a configuration/grouping that applies to a subset of
floor and residue vectors within a mapping.  The submap functions as a
last layer of indirection such that specific special floor or residue
settings can be applied not only to all the vectors in a given mode,
but also specific vectors in a specific mode.  Each submap specifies
the proper floor and residue instance number to use for decoding that
submap's spectral floor and spectral residue vectors.</p><p>
As an example:</p><p>
Assume a Vorbis stream that contains six channels in the standard 5.1
format.  The sixth channel, as is normal in 5.1, is bass only.
Therefore it would be wasteful to encode a full-spectrum version of it
as with the other channels.  The submapping mechanism can be used to
apply a full range floor and residue encoding to channels 0 through 4,
and a bass-only representation to the bass channel, thus saving space.
In this example, channels 0-4 belong to submap 0 (which indicates use
of a full-range floor) and channel 5 belongs to submap 1, which uses a
bass-only representation.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="id258391"></a>1.2.4. Floor</h4></div></div></div><p>
Vorbis encodes a spectral 'floor' vector for each PCM channel.  This
vector is a low-resolution representation of the audio spectrum for
the given channel in the current frame, generally used akin to a
whitening filter.  It is named a 'floor' because the Xiph.Org
reference encoder has historically used it as a unit-baseline for
spectral resolution.</p><p>
A floor encoding may be of two types.  Floor 0 uses a packed LSP
representation on a dB amplitude scale and Bark frequency scale.
Floor 1 represents the curve as a piecewise linear interpolated
representation on a dB amplitude scale and linear frequency scale.
The two floors are semantically interchangeable in
encoding/decoding. However, floor type 1 provides more stable
inter-frame behavior, and so is the preferred choice in all
coupled-stereo and high bitrate modes.  Floor 1 is also considerably
less expensive to decode than floor 0.</p><p>
Floor 0 is not to be considered deprecated, but it is of limited
modern use.  No known Vorbis encoder past Xiph.org's own beta 4 makes
use of floor 0.</p><p>
The values coded/decoded by a floor are both compactly formatted and
make use of entropy coding to save space.  For this reason, a floor
configuration generally refers to multiple codebooks in the codebook
component list.  Entropy coding is thus provided as an abstraction,
and each floor instance may choose from any and all available
codebooks when coding/decoding.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="id258423"></a>1.2.5. Residue</h4></div></div></div><p>
The spectral residue is the fine structure of the audio spectrum
once the floor curve has been subtracted out.  In simplest terms, it
is coded in the bitstream using cascaded (multi-pass) vector
quantization according to one of three specific packing/coding
algorithms numbered 0 through 2.  The packing algorithm details are
configured by residue instance.  As with the floor components, the
final VQ/entropy encoding is provided by external codebook instances
and each residue instance may choose from any and all available
codebooks.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="id258437"></a>1.2.6. Codebooks</h4></div></div></div><p>
Codebooks are a self-contained abstraction that perform entropy
decoding and, optionally, use the entropy-decoded integer value as an
offset into an index of output value vectors, returning the indicated
vector of values.</p><p>
The entropy coding in a Vorbis I codebook is provided by a standard
Huffman binary tree representation.  This tree is tightly packed using
one of several methods, depending on whether codeword lengths are
ordered or unordered, or the tree is sparse.</p><p>
The codebook vector index is similarly packed according to index
characteristic.  Most commonly, the vector index is encoded as a
single list of values of possible values that are then permuted into
a list of n-dimensional rows (lattice VQ).</p></div></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id258461"></a>1.3. High-level Decode Process</h3></div></div></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="id258467"></a>1.3.1. Decode Setup</h4></div></div></div><p>
Before decoding can begin, a decoder must initialize using the
bitstream headers matching the stream to be decoded.  Vorbis uses
three header packets; all are required, in-order, by this
specification. Once set up, decode may begin at any audio packet
belonging to the Vorbis stream. In Vorbis I, all packets after the
three initial headers are audio packets. </p><p>
The header packets are, in order, the identification
header, the comments header, and the setup header.</p><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h5 class="title"><a name="id314074"></a>1.3.1.1. Identification Header</h5></div></div></div><p>
The identification header identifies the bitstream as Vorbis, Vorbis
version, and the simple audio characteristics of the stream such as
sample rate and number of channels.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h5 class="title"><a name="id314086"></a>1.3.1.2. Comment Header</h5></div></div></div><p>
The comment header includes user text comments ("tags") and a vendor
string for the application/library that produced the bitstream.  The
encoding and proper use of the comment header is described in 
<a href="#vorbis-spec-comment" title="5. comment field and header specification">Section 5, &#8220;comment field and header specification&#8221;</a>.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h5 class="title"><a name="id314101"></a>1.3.1.3. Setup Header</h5></div></div></div><p>
The setup header includes extensive CODEC setup information as well as
the complete VQ and Huffman codebooks needed for decode.</p></div></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="id314113"></a>1.3.2. Decode Procedure</h4></div></div></div><div class="highlights"><p>
The decoding and synthesis procedure for all audio packets is
fundamentally the same.
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li>decode packet type flag</li><li>decode mode number</li><li>decode window shape (long windows only)</li><li>decode floor</li><li>decode residue into residue vectors</li><li>inverse channel coupling of residue vectors</li><li>generate floor curve from decoded floor data</li><li>compute dot product of floor and residue, producing audio spectrum vector</li><li>inverse monolithic transform of audio spectrum vector, always an MDCT in Vorbis I</li><li>overlap/add left-hand output of transform with right-hand output of previous frame</li><li>store right hand-data from transform of current frame for future lapping</li><li>if not first frame, return results of overlap/add as audio result of current frame</li></ol></div><p>
</p></div><p>
Note that clever rearrangement of the synthesis arithmetic is
possible; as an example, one can take advantage of symmetries in the
MDCT to store the right-hand transform data of a partial MDCT for a
50% inter-frame buffer space savings, and then complete the transform
later before overlap/add with the next frame.  This optimization
produces entirely equivalent output and is naturally perfectly legal.
The decoder must be <span class="emphasis"><em>entirely mathematically equivalent</em></span> to the
specification, it need not be a literal semantic implementation.</p><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h5 class="title"><a name="id314203"></a>1.3.2.1. Packet type decode</h5></div></div></div><p>
Vorbis I uses four packet types. The first three packet types mark each
of the three Vorbis headers described above. The fourth packet type
marks an audio packet. All other packet types are reserved; packets
marked with a reserved type should be ignored.</p><p>
Following the three header packets, all packets in a Vorbis I stream
are audio.  The first step of audio packet decode is to read and
verify the packet type; <span class="emphasis"><em>a non-audio packet when audio is expected
indicates stream corruption or a non-compliant stream. The decoder
must ignore the packet and not attempt decoding it to
audio</em></span>.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h5 class="title"><a name="id314225"></a>1.3.2.2. Mode decode</h5></div></div></div><p>
Vorbis allows an encoder to set up multiple, numbered packet 'modes',
as described earlier, all of which may be used in a given Vorbis
stream. The mode is encoded as an integer used as a direct offset into
the mode instance index. </p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h5 class="title"><a name="vorbis-spec-window"></a>1.3.2.3. Window shape decode (long windows only)</h5></div></div></div><p>
Vorbis frames may be one of two PCM sample sizes specified during
codec setup.  In Vorbis I, legal frame sizes are powers of two from 64
to 8192 samples.  Aside from coupling, Vorbis handles channels as
independent vectors and these frame sizes are in samples per channel.</p><p>
Vorbis uses an overlapping transform, namely the MDCT, to blend one
frame into the next, avoiding most inter-frame block boundary
artifacts.  The MDCT output of one frame is windowed according to MDCT
requirements, overlapped 50% with the output of the previous frame and
added.  The window shape assures seamless reconstruction.  </p><p>
This is easy to visualize in the case of equal sized-windows:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="window1.png" alt="overlap of two equal-sized windows"></div><p>
And slightly more complex in the case of overlapping unequal sized
windows:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="window2.png" alt="overlap of a long and a short window"></div><p>
In the unequal-sized window case, the window shape of the long window
must be modified for seamless lapping as above.  It is possible to
correctly infer window shape to be applied to the current window from
knowing the sizes of the current, previous and next window.  It is
legal for a decoder to use this method. However, in the case of a long
window (short windows require no modification), Vorbis also codes two
flag bits to specify pre- and post- window shape.  Although not
strictly necessary for function, this minor redundancy allows a packet
to be fully decoded to the point of lapping entirely independently of
any other packet, allowing easier abstraction of decode layers as well
as allowing a greater level of easy parallelism in encode and
decode.</p><p>
A description of valid window functions for use with an inverse MDCT
can be found in the paper

</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h5 class="title"><a name="id339168"></a>1.3.2.4. floor decode</h5></div></div></div><p>
Each floor is encoded/decoded in channel order, however each floor
belongs to a 'submap' that specifies which floor configuration to
use.  All floors are decoded before residue decode begins.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h5 class="title"><a name="id339179"></a>1.3.2.5. residue decode</h5></div></div></div><p>
Although the number of residue vectors equals the number of channels,
channel coupling may mean that the raw residue vectors extracted
during decode do not map directly to specific channels.  When channel
coupling is in use, some vectors will correspond to coupled magnitude
or angle.  The coupling relationships are described in the codec setup
and may differ from frame to frame, due to different mode numbers.</p><p>
Vorbis codes residue vectors in groups by submap; the coding is done
in submap order from submap 0 through n-1.  This differs from floors
which are coded using a configuration provided by submap number, but
are coded individually in channel order.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h5 class="title"><a name="id339196"></a>1.3.2.6. inverse channel coupling</h5></div></div></div><p>
A detailed discussion of stereo in the Vorbis codec can be found in
the document <a href="stereo.html" target="_top"><em class="citetitle">Stereo Channel Coupling in the
Vorbis CODEC</em></a>.  Vorbis is not limited to only stereo coupling, but
the stereo document also gives a good overview of the generic coupling
mechanism.</p><p>
Vorbis coupling applies to pairs of residue vectors at a time;
decoupling is done in-place a pair at a time in the order and using
the vectors specified in the current mapping configuration.  The
decoupling operation is the same for all pairs, converting square
polar representation (where one vector is magnitude and the second
angle) back to Cartesian representation.</p><p>
After decoupling, in order, each pair of vectors on the coupling list, 
the resulting residue vectors represent the fine spectral detail
of each output channel.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h5 class="title"><a name="id339224"></a>1.3.2.7. generate floor curve</h5></div></div></div><p>
The decoder may choose to generate the floor curve at any appropriate
time.  It is reasonable to generate the output curve when the floor
data is decoded from the raw packet, or it can be generated after
inverse coupling and applied to the spectral residue directly,
combining generation and the dot product into one step and eliminating
some working space.</p><p>
Both floor 0 and floor 1 generate a linear-range, linear-domain output
vector to be multiplied (dot product) by the linear-range,
linear-domain spectral residue.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h5 class="title"><a name="id339240"></a>1.3.2.8. compute floor/residue dot product</h5></div></div></div><p>
This step is straightforward; for each output channel, the decoder
multiplies the floor curve and residue vectors element by element,
producing the finished audio spectrum of each channel.</p><p>
One point is worth mentioning about this dot product; a common mistake
in a fixed point implementation might be to assume that a 32 bit
fixed-point representation for floor and residue and direct
multiplication of the vectors is sufficient for acceptable spectral
depth in all cases because it happens to mostly work with the current
Xiph.Org reference encoder.</p><p>
However, floor vector values can span ~140dB (~24 bits unsigned), and
the audio spectrum vector should represent a minimum of 120dB (~21
bits with sign), even when output is to a 16 bit PCM device.  For the
residue vector to represent full scale if the floor is nailed to
-140dB, it must be able to span 0 to +140dB.  For the residue vector
to reach full scale if the floor is nailed at 0dB, it must be able to
represent -140dB to +0dB.  Thus, in order to handle full range
dynamics, a residue vector may span -140dB to +140dB entirely within
spec.  A 280dB range is approximately 48 bits with sign; thus the
residue vector must be able to represent a 48 bit range and the dot
product must be able to handle an effective 48 bit times 24 bit
multiplication.  This range may be achieved using large (64 bit or
larger) integers, or implementing a movable binary point
representation.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h5 class="title"><a name="id339268"></a>1.3.2.9. inverse monolithic transform (MDCT)</h5></div></div></div><p>
The audio spectrum is converted back into time domain PCM audio via an
inverse Modified Discrete Cosine Transform (MDCT).  A detailed
description of the MDCT is available in the paper <a href="http://www.iocon.com/resource/docs/ps/eusipco_corrected.ps" target="_top">&#8220;<span class="citetitle">The use of multirate filter banks for coding of high quality digital
audio</span>&#8221;</a>, by T. Sporer, K. Brandenburg and B. Edler.</p><p>
Note that the PCM produced directly from the MDCT is not yet finished
audio; it must be lapped with surrounding frames using an appropriate
window (such as the Vorbis window) before the MDCT can be considered
orthogonal.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h5 class="title"><a name="id339292"></a>1.3.2.10. overlap/add data</h5></div></div></div><p>
Windowed MDCT output is overlapped and added with the right hand data
of the previous window such that the 3/4 point of the previous window
is aligned with the 1/4 point of the current window (as illustrated in
the window overlap diagram). At this point, the audio data between the
center of the previous frame and the center of the current frame is
now finished and ready to be returned. </p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h5 class="title"><a name="id339304"></a>1.3.2.11. cache right hand data</h5></div></div></div><p>
The decoder must cache the right hand portion of the current frame to

The overlapped portion produced from overlapping the previous and
current frame data is finished data to be returned by the decoder.
This data spans from the center of the previous window to the center
of the current window.  In the case of same-sized windows, the amount
of data to return is one-half block consisting of and only of the
overlapped portions. When overlapping a short and long window, much of
the returned range is not actually overlap.  This does not damage
transform orthogonality.  Pay attention however to returning the
correct data range; the amount of data to be returned is:

</p><pre class="programlisting">
window_blocksize(previous_window)/4+window_blocksize(current_window)/4
</pre><p>

from the center of the previous window to the center of the current
window.</p><p>
Data is not returned from the first frame; it must be used to 'prime'
the decode engine.  The encoder accounts for this priming when
calculating PCM offsets; after the first frame, the proper PCM output
offset is '0' (as no data has been returned yet).</p></div></div></div></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="vorbis-spec-bitpacking"></a>2. Bitpacking Convention</h2></div><div><p class="releaseinfo">

The Vorbis codec uses relatively unstructured raw packets containing
arbitrary-width binary integer fields.  Logically, these packets are a
bitstream in which bits are coded one-by-one by the encoder and then
read one-by-one in the same monotonically increasing order by the
decoder.  Most current binary storage arrangements group bits into a
native word size of eight bits (octets), sixteen bits, thirty-two bits
or, less commonly other fixed word sizes.  The Vorbis bitpacking
convention specifies the correct mapping of the logical packet
bitstream into an actual representation in fixed-width words.
</p><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="id304890"></a>2.1.1. octets, bytes and words</h4></div></div></div><p>
In most contemporary architectures, a 'byte' is synonymous with an
'octet', that is, eight bits.  This has not always been the case;
seven, ten, eleven and sixteen bit 'bytes' have been used.  For
purposes of the bitpacking convention, a byte implies the native,
smallest integer storage representation offered by a platform.  On
modern platforms, this is generally assumed to be eight bits (not
necessarily because of the processor but because of the
filesystem/memory architecture.  Modern filesystems invariably offer
bytes as the fundamental atom of storage).  A 'word' is an integer
size that is a grouped multiple of this smallest size.</p><p>
The most ubiquitous architectures today consider a 'byte' to be an
octet (eight bits) and a word to be a group of two, four or eight
bytes (16, 32 or 64 bits).  Note however that the Vorbis bitpacking
convention is still well defined for any native byte size; Vorbis uses
the native bit-width of a given storage system. This document assumes
that a byte is one octet for purposes of example.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="id304832"></a>2.1.2. bit order</h4></div></div></div><p>
A byte has a well-defined 'least significant' bit (LSb), which is the
only bit set when the byte is storing the two's complement integer
value +1.  A byte's 'most significant' bit (MSb) is at the opposite
end of the byte. Bits in a byte are numbered from zero at the LSb to
<span class="emphasis"><em>n</em></span> (<span class="emphasis"><em>n</em></span>=7 in an octet) for the
MSb.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="id327953"></a>2.1.3. byte order</h4></div></div></div><p>
Words are native groupings of multiple bytes.  Several byte orderings
are possible in a word; the common ones are 3-2-1-0 ('big endian' or
'most significant byte first' in which the highest-valued byte comes
first), 0-1-2-3 ('little endian' or 'least significant byte first' in
which the lowest value byte comes first) and less commonly 3-1-2-0 and
0-2-1-3 ('mixed endian').</p><p>
The Vorbis bitpacking convention specifies storage and bitstream
manipulation at the byte, not word, level, thus host word ordering is
of a concern only during optimization when writing high performance
code that operates on a word of storage at a time rather than by byte.
Logically, bytes are always coded and decoded in order from byte zero
through byte <span class="emphasis"><em>n</em></span>.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="id336382"></a>2.1.4. coding bits into byte sequences</h4></div></div></div><p>
The Vorbis codec has need to code arbitrary bit-width integers, from
zero to 32 bits wide, into packets.  These integer fields are not
aligned to the boundaries of the byte representation; the next field
is written at the bit position at which the previous field ends.</p><p>
The encoder logically packs integers by writing the LSb of a binary
integer to the logical bitstream first, followed by next least
significant bit, etc, until the requested number of bits have been
coded.  When packing the bits into bytes, the encoder begins by
placing the LSb of the integer to be written into the least
significant unused bit position of the destination byte, followed by
the next-least significant bit of the source integer and so on up to
the requested number of bits.  When all bits of the destination byte
have been filled, encoding continues by zeroing all bits of the next
byte and writing the next bit into the bit position 0 of that byte.
Decoding follows the same process as encoding, but by reading bits
from the byte stream and reassembling them into integers.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="id310906"></a>2.1.5. signedness</h4></div></div></div><p>
The signedness of a specific number resulting from decode is to be
interpreted by the decoder given decode context.  That is, the three
bit binary pattern 'b111' can be taken to represent either 'seven' as
an unsigned integer, or '-1' as a signed, two's complement integer.
The encoder and decoder are responsible for knowing if fields are to
be treated as signed or unsigned.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="id258112"></a>2.1.6. coding example</h4></div></div></div><p>

We read two, two-bit integer fields, resulting in the returned numbers
'b00' and 'b11'.  Two things are worth noting here:

</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Although these four bits were originally written as a single
four-bit integer, reading some other combination of bit-widths from the
bitstream is well defined.  There are no artificial alignment
boundaries maintained in the bitstream.</p></li><li><p>The second value is the
two-bit-wide integer 'b11'.  This value may be interpreted either as
the unsigned value '3', or the signed value '-1'.  Signedness is
dependent on decode context.</p></li></ul></div><p>
</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="id259912"></a>2.1.8. end-of-packet alignment</h4></div></div></div><p>
The typical use of bitpacking is to produce many independent
byte-aligned packets which are embedded into a larger byte-aligned
container structure, such as an Ogg transport bitstream.  Externally,
each bytestream (encoded bitstream) must begin and end on a byte
boundary.  Often, the encoded bitstream is not an integer number of
bytes, and so there is unused (uncoded) space in the last byte of a
packet.</p><p>
Unused space in the last byte of a bytestream is always zeroed during
the coding process.  Thus, should this unused space be read, it will
return binary zeroes.</p><p>
Attempting to read past the end of an encoded packet results in an
'end-of-packet' condition.  End-of-packet is not to be considered an
error; it is merely a state indicating that there is insufficient
remaining data to fulfill the desired read size.  Vorbis uses truncated
packets as a normal mode of operation, and as such, decoders must
handle reading past the end of a packet as a typical mode of
operation. Any further read operations after an 'end-of-packet'
condition shall also return 'end-of-packet'.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="id259938"></a>2.1.9.  reading zero bits</h4></div></div></div><p>
Reading a zero-bit-wide integer returns the value '0' and does not
increment the stream cursor.  Reading to the end of the packet (but
not past, such that an 'end-of-packet' condition has not triggered)
and then reading a zero bit integer shall succeed, returning 0, and
not trigger an end-of-packet condition.  Reading a zero-bit-wide
integer after a previous read sets 'end-of-packet' shall also fail
with 'end-of-packet'.</p></div></div></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="vorbis-spec-codebook"></a>3. Probability Model and Codebooks</h2></div><div><p class="releaseinfo">

Unlike practically every other mainstream audio codec, Vorbis has no
statically configured probability model, instead packing all entropy
decoding configuration, VQ and Huffman, into the bitstream itself in
the third header, the codec setup header.  This packed configuration
consists of multiple 'codebooks', each containing a specific
Huffman-equivalent representation for decoding compressed codewords as
well as an optional lookup table of output vector values to which a
decoded Huffman value is applied as an offset, generating the final
decoded output corresponding to a given compressed codeword.</p><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="id335318"></a>3.1.1. Bitwise operation</h4></div></div></div><p>

the codebooks themselves and the codewords they decode are unrolled

Unlike most binary numerical values in this document, we
intend the above codewords to be read and used bit by bit from left to
right, thus the codeword '001' is the bit string 'zero, zero, one'.
When determining 'lowest possible value' in the assignment definition
above, the leftmost bit is the MSb.</p></div><p>
It is clear that the codeword length list represents a Huffman
decision tree with the entry numbers equivalent to the leaves numbered
left-to-right:

</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="hufftree.png" alt="[huffman tree illustration]"></div><p>
</p><p>
As we assign codewords in order, we see that each choice constructs a
new leaf in the leftmost possible position.</p><p>
Note that it's possible to underspecify or overspecify a Huffman tree
via the length list.  In the above example, if codeword seven were
eliminated, it's clear that the tree is unfinished:

</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="hufftree-under.png" alt="[underspecified huffman tree illustration]"></div><p>
</p><p>
Similarly, in the original codebook, it's clear that the tree is fully
populated and a ninth codeword is impossible.  Both underspecified and
overspecified trees are an error condition rendering the stream
undecodable.</p><p>
Codebook entries marked 'unused' are simply skipped in the assigning
process.  They have no codeword and do not appear in the decision
tree, thus it's impossible for any bit pattern read from the stream to
decode to that entry number.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h5 class="title"><a name="id316419"></a>3.2.1.2. VQ lookup table vector representation</h5></div></div></div><p>

The decoder uses the codebook abstraction much as it does the
bit-unpacking convention; a specific codebook reads a
codeword from the bitstream, decoding it into an entry number, and then
returns that entry number to the decoder (when used in a scalar
entropy coding context), or uses that entry number as an offset into
the VQ lookup table, returning a vector of values (when used in a context
desiring a VQ value). Scalar or VQ context is always explicit; any call
to the codebook mechanism requests either a scalar entry number or a
lookup vector.</p><p>
Note that VQ lookup type zero indicates that there is no lookup table;
requesting decode using a codebook of lookup type 0 in any context
expecting a vector return value (even in a case where a vector of
dimension one) is forbidden.  If decoder setup or decode requests such
an action, that is an error condition rendering the packet
undecodable.</p><p>
Using a codebook to read from the packet bitstream consists first of
reading and decoding the next codeword in the bitstream. The decoder
reads bits until the accumulated bits match a codeword in the
codebook.  This process can be though of as logically walking the
Huffman decode tree by reading one bit at a time from the bitstream,
and using the bit as a decision boolean to take the 0 branch (left in
the above examples) or the 1 branch (right in the above examples).
Walking the tree finishes when the decode process hits a leaf in the
decision tree; the result is the entry number corresponding to that
leaf.  Reading past the end of a packet propagates the 'end-of-stream'
condition to the decoder.</p><p>
When used in a scalar context, the resulting codeword entry is the
desired return value.</p><p>
When used in a VQ context, the codeword entry number is used as an
offset into the VQ lookup table.  The value returned to the decoder is
the vector of scalars corresponding to this offset.</p></div></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="vorbis-spec-codec"></a>4. Codec Setup and Packet Decode</h2></div><div><p class="releaseinfo">

This document serves as the top-level reference document for the
bit-by-bit decode specification of Vorbis I.  This document assumes a
high-level understanding of the Vorbis decode process, which is
provided in <a href="#vorbis-spec-intro" title="1. Introduction and Description">Section 1, &#8220;Introduction and Description&#8221;</a>.  <a href="#vorbis-spec-bitpacking" title="2. Bitpacking Convention">Section 2, &#8220;Bitpacking Convention&#8221;</a> covers reading and writing bit fields from
and to bitstream packets.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id326710"></a>4.2. Header decode and decode setup</h3></div></div></div><p>
A Vorbis bitstream begins with three header packets. The header
packets are, in order, the identification header, the comments header,
and the setup header. All are required for decode compliance.  An
end-of-packet condition during decoding the first or third header
packet renders the stream undecodable.  End-of-packet decoding the
comment header is a non-fatal error condition.</p><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="id337747"></a>4.2.1. Common header decode</h4></div></div></div><p>
Each header packet begins with the same header fields.
</p><pre class="screen">
  1) [packet_type] : 8 bit value
  2) 0x76, 0x6f, 0x72, 0x62, 0x69, 0x73: the characters 'v','o','r','b','i','s' as six octets
</pre><p>
Decode continues according to packet type; the identification header
is type 1, the comment header type 3 and the setup header type 5
(these types are all odd as a packet with a leading single bit of '0'
is an audio packet).  The packets must occur in the order of
identification, comment, setup.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="id317806"></a>4.2.2. Identification header</h4></div></div></div><p>
The identification header is a short header of only a few fields used
to declare the stream definitively as Vorbis, and provide a few externally
relevant pieces of information about the audio stream. The
identification header is coded as follows:</p><pre class="screen">
 1) [vorbis_version] = read 32 bits as unsigned integer
 2) [audio_channels] = read 8 bit integer as unsigned
 3) [audio_sample_rate] = read 32 bits as unsigned integer
 4) [bitrate_maximum] = read 32 bits as signed integer
 5) [bitrate_nominal] = read 32 bits as signed integer
 6) [bitrate_minimum] = read 32 bits as signed integer
 7) [blocksize_0] = 2 exponent (read 4 bits as unsigned integer)
 8) [blocksize_1] = 2 exponent (read 4 bits as unsigned integer)
 9) [framing_flag] = read one bit
</pre><p>
<code class="varname">[vorbis_version]</code> is to read '0' in order to be compatible
with this document.  Both <code class="varname">[audio_channels]</code> and
<code class="varname">[audio_sample_rate]</code> must read greater than zero.  Allowed final
blocksize values are 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096 and 8192 in
Vorbis I.  <code class="varname">[blocksize_0]</code> must be less than or equal to
<code class="varname">[blocksize_1]</code>.  The framing bit must be nonzero.  Failure to
meet any of these conditions renders a stream undecodable.</p><p>
The bitrate fields above are used only as hints. The nominal bitrate
field especially may be considerably off in purely VBR streams.  The
fields are meaningful only when greater than zero.</p><p>
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li>All three fields set to the same value implies a fixed rate, or tightly bounded, nearly fixed-rate bitstream</li><li>Only nominal set implies a VBR or ABR stream that averages the nominal bitrate</li><li>Maximum and or minimum set implies a VBR bitstream that obeys the bitrate limits</li><li>None set indicates the encoder does not care to speculate.</li></ul></div><p>

The setup header contains the bulk of the codec setup information
needed for decode.  The setup header contains, in order, the lists of
codebook configurations, time-domain transform configurations
(placeholders in Vorbis I), floor configurations, residue
configurations, channel mapping configurations and mode
configurations. It finishes with a framing bit of '1'.  Header decode
proceeds in the following order:</p><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h5 class="title"><a name="id305504"></a>4.2.4.1. Codebooks</h5></div></div></div><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><code class="varname">[vorbis_codebook_count]</code> = read eight bits as unsigned integer and add one</li><li>Decode <code class="varname">[vorbis_codebook_count]</code> codebooks in order as defined

For each channel, synthesize the floor curve from the decoded floor
information, according to packet type. Note that the vector synthesis
length for floor computation is <code class="varname">[n]</code>/2.</p><p>
For each channel, multiply each element of the floor curve by each
element of that channel's residue vector.  The result is the dot
product of the floor and residue vectors for each channel; the produced
vectors are the length <code class="varname">[n]</code>/2 audio spectrum for each
channel.</p><p>
One point is worth mentioning about this dot product; a common mistake
in a fixed point implementation might be to assume that a 32 bit
fixed-point representation for floor and residue and direct
multiplication of the vectors is sufficient for acceptable spectral
depth in all cases because it happens to mostly work with the current
Xiph.Org reference encoder. </p><p>
However, floor vector values can span ~140dB (~24 bits unsigned), and
the audio spectrum vector should represent a minimum of 120dB (~21
bits with sign), even when output is to a 16 bit PCM device.  For the
residue vector to represent full scale if the floor is nailed to
-140dB, it must be able to span 0 to +140dB.  For the residue vector
to reach full scale if the floor is nailed at 0dB, it must be able to
represent -140dB to +0dB.  Thus, in order to handle full range
dynamics, a residue vector may span -140dB to +140dB entirely within
spec.  A 280dB range is approximately 48 bits with sign; thus the
residue vector must be able to represent a 48 bit range and the dot
product must be able to handle an effective 48 bit times 24 bit
multiplication.  This range may be achieved using large (64 bit or
larger) integers, or implementing a movable binary point
representation.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="id343829"></a>4.3.7. inverse MDCT</h4></div></div></div><p>
Convert the audio spectrum vector of each channel back into time
domain PCM audio via an inverse Modified Discrete Cosine Transform
(MDCT).  A detailed description of the MDCT is available in the paper
<a href="http://www.iocon.com/resource/docs/ps/eusipco_corrected.ps" target="_top">&#8220;<span class="citetitle">The
use of multirate filter banks for coding of high quality digital
audio</span>&#8221;</a>, by T. Sporer, K. Brandenburg and B. Edler.  The window
function used for the MDCT is the function described earlier.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="id343850"></a>4.3.8. overlap_add</h4></div></div></div><p>
Windowed MDCT output is overlapped and added with the right hand data
of the previous window such that the 3/4 point of the previous window
is aligned with the 1/4 point of the current window (as illustrated in
<a href="#vorbis-spec-window" title="1.3.2.3. Window shape decode (long windows only)">Section 1.3.2.3, &#8220;Window shape decode (long windows only)&#8221;</a>).  The overlapped portion
produced from overlapping the previous and current frame data is
finished data to be returned by the decoder.  This data spans from the
center of the previous window to the center of the current window.  In
the case of same-sized windows, the amount of data to return is
one-half block consisting of and only of the overlapped portions. When
overlapping a short and long window, much of the returned range does not
actually overlap.  This does not damage transform orthogonality.  Pay
attention however to returning the correct data range; the amount of
data to be returned is:

</p><pre class="programlisting">
window_blocksize(previous_window)/4+window_blocksize(current_window)/4
</pre><p>

from the center (element windowsize/2) of the previous window to the
center (element windowsize/2-1, inclusive) of the current window.</p><p>
Data is not returned from the first frame; it must be used to 'prime'
the decode engine.  The encoder accounts for this priming when
calculating PCM offsets; after the first frame, the proper PCM output
offset is '0' (as no data has been returned yet).</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="id343883"></a>4.3.9. output channel order</h4></div></div></div><p>
Vorbis I specifies only a channel mapping type 0.  In mapping type 0,
channel mapping is implicitly defined as follows for standard audio
applications:</p><div class="variablelist"><dl><dt><span class="term">one channel</span></dt><dd>the stream is monophonic</dd><dt><span class="term">two channels</span></dt><dd>the stream is stereo.  channel order: left, right</dd><dt><span class="term">three channels</span></dt><dd>the stream is a 1d-surround encoding.  channel order: left,

Applications using Vorbis for dedicated purposes may define channel
mapping as seen fit.  Future channel mappings (such as three and four
channel <a href="http://www.ambisonic.net/" target="_top">Ambisonics</a>) will
make use of channel mappings other than mapping 0.</p></div></div></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="vorbis-spec-comment"></a>5. comment field and header specification</h2></div><div><p class="releaseinfo">

greater structure and machine parseability.</p><p>The comment field is meant to be used much like someone jotting a
quick note on the bottom of a CDR. It should be a little information to
remember the disc by and explain it to others; a short, to-the-point
text note that need not only be a couple words, but isn't going to be
more than a short paragraph.  The essentials, in other words, whatever
they turn out to be, eg:

The comment header is logically a list of eight-bit-clean vectors; the
number of vectors is bounded to 2^32-1 and the length of each vector
is limited to 2^32-1 bytes. The vector length is encoded; the vector
contents themselves are not null terminated. In addition to the vector
list, there is a single vector for vendor name (also 8 bit clean,
length encoded in 32 bits). For example, the 1.0 release of libvorbis 
set the vendor string to "Xiph.Org libVorbis I 20020717".</p><p>The comment header is decoded as follows:

</p><pre class="programlisting">
  1) [vendor_length] = read an unsigned integer of 32 bits
  2) [vendor_string] = read a UTF-8 vector as [vendor_length] octets
  3) [user_comment_list_length] = read an unsigned integer of 32 bits
  4) iterate [user_comment_list_length] times {
       5) [length] = read an unsigned integer of 32 bits
       6) this iteration's user comment = read a UTF-8 vector as [length] octets
     }
  7) [framing_bit] = read a single bit as boolean
  8) if ( [framing_bit] unset or end-of-packet ) then ERROR
  9) done.

The comment vectors are structured similarly to a UNIX environment variable.
That is, comment fields consist of a field name and a corresponding value and
look like:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><pre class="programlisting">

The field name is case-insensitive and may consist of ASCII 0x20
through 0x7D, 0x3D ('=') excluded. ASCII 0x41 through 0x5A inclusive
(characters A-Z) is to be considered equivalent to ASCII 0x61 through 
0x7A inclusive (characters a-z).
</p><p>
The field name is immediately followed by ASCII 0x3D ('=');
this equals sign is used to terminate the field name.

0x3D is followed by 8 bit clean UTF-8 encoded value of the
field contents to the end of the field.

generally the only packet on the second page and may not be restricted
to within the second bitstream page.  The length of the comment header
packet is (practically) unbounded.  The comment header packet is not
optional; it must be present in the bitstream even if it is
effectively empty.</p><p>
The comment header is encoded as follows (as per Ogg's standard
bitstream mapping which renders least-significant-bit of the word to be
coded into the least significant available bit of the current
bitstream octet first):

</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li>

Vorbis floor type zero uses Line Spectral Pair (LSP, also alternately
known as Line Spectral Frequency or LSF) representation to encode a
smooth spectral envelope curve as the frequency response of the LSP
filter.  This representation is equivalent to a traditional all-pole
infinite impulse response filter as would be used in linear predictive
coding; LSP representation may be converted to LPC representation and
vice-versa.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id321046"></a>6.2. Floor 0 format</h3></div></div></div><p>

Configuration information for instances of floor zero decodes from the

Take note of the following properties of decode:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li>An <code class="varname">[amplitude]</code> value of zero must result in a return code that indicates this channel is unused in this frame (the output of the channel will be all-zeroes in synthesis).  Several later stages of decode don't occur for an unused channel.</li><li>An end-of-packet condition during decode should be considered a
nominal occruence; if end-of-packet is reached during any read
operation above, floor decode is to return 'unused' status as if the
<code class="varname">[amplitude]</code> value had read zero at the beginning of decode.</li><li>The book number used for decode
can, in fact, be stored in the bitstream in <a href="#vorbis-spec-ilog" title="9.2.1. ilog">ilog</a>( <code class="varname">[floor0_number_of_books]</code> -

greater than the maximum possible book value are reserved.</li><li>The number of scalars read into the vector <code class="varname">[coefficients]</code>
may be greater than <code class="varname">[floor0_order]</code>, the number actually
required for curve computation.  For example, if the VQ codebook used
for the floor currently being decoded has a
<code class="varname">[codebook_dimensions]</code> value of three and
<code class="varname">[floor0_order]</code> is ten, the only way to fill all the needed
scalars in <code class="varname">[coefficients]</code> is to to read a total of twelve
scalars as four vectors of three scalars each.  This is not an error
condition, and care must be taken not to allow a buffer overflow in
decode. The extra values are not used and may be ignored or discarded.</li></ul></div><p>

Floor type one represents a spectral curve as a series of
line segments.  Synthesis constructs a floor curve using iterative
prediction in a process roughly equivalent to the following simplified
description:</p><p>
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li> the first line segment (base case) is a logical line spanning
from x_0,y_0 to x_1,y_1 where in the base case x_0=0 and x_1=[n], the
full range of the spectral floor to be computed.</li><li>the induction step chooses a point x_new within an existing
logical line segment and produces a y_new value at that point computed
from the existing line's y value at x_new (as plotted by the line) and
a difference value decoded from the bitstream packet.</li><li>floor computation produces two new line segments, one running from
x_0,y_0 to x_new,y_new and from x_new,y_new to x_1,y_1. This step is
performed logically even if y_new represents no change to the
amplitude value at x_new so that later refinement is additionally
bounded at x_new.</li><li>the induction step repeats, using a list of x values specified in
the codec setup header at floor 1 initialization time.  Computation
is completed at the end of the x value list.</li></ul></div><p>
</p><p>
Consider the following example, with values chosen for ease of
understanding rather than representing typical configuration:</p><p>
For the below example, we assume a floor setup with an [n] of 128.
The list of selected X values in increasing order is
0,16,32,48,64,80,96,112 and 128.  In list order, the values interleave
as 0, 128, 64, 32, 96, 16, 48, 80 and 112.  The corresponding
list-order Y values as decoded from an example packet are 110, 20, -5,
-45, 0, -25, -10, 30 and -10.  We compute the floor in the following
way, beginning with the first line:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="floor1-1.png" alt="[graph of example floor]"></div><p>
We now draw new logical lines to reflect the correction to new_Y, and
iterate for X positions 32 and 96:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="floor1-2.png" alt="[graph of example floor]"></div><p>
Although the new Y value at X position 96 is unchanged, it is still
used later as an endpoint for further refinement.  From here on, the
pattern should be clear; we complete the floor computation as follows:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="floor1-3.png" alt="[graph of example floor]"></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="floor1-4.png" alt="[graph of example floor]"></div><p>
A more efficient algorithm with carefully defined integer rounding
behavior is used for actual decode, as described later.  The actual
algorithm splits Y value computation and line plotting into two steps
with modifications to the above algorithm to eliminate noise
accumulation through integer roundoff/truncation. </p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="id317351"></a>7.2.2. header decode</h4></div></div></div><p>
A list of floor X values is stored in the packet header in interleaved
format (used in list order during packet decode and synthesis).  This
list is split into partitions, and each partition is assigned to a
partition class.  X positions 0 and [n] are implicit and do not belong
to an explicit partition or partition class.</p><p>
A partition class consists of a representation vector width (the
number of Y values which the partition class encodes at once), a
'subclass' value representing the number of alternate entropy books
the partition class may use in representing Y values, the list of
[subclass] books and a master book used to encode which alternate
books were chosen for representation in a given packet.  The
master/subclass mechanism is meant to be used as a flexible
representation cascade while still using codebooks only in a scalar
context.</p><pre class="screen">

derives final Y amplitude values from the encoded, wrapped difference
values taken from the bitstream.  The second step plots the curve

A residue vector represents the fine detail of the audio spectrum of
one channel in an audio frame after the encoder subtracts the floor
curve and performs any channel coupling.  A residue vector may
represent spectral lines, spectral magnitude, spectral phase or
hybrids as mixed by channel coupling.  The exact semantic content of
the vector does not matter to the residue abstraction.</p><p>
Whatever the exact qualities, the Vorbis residue abstraction codes the
residue vectors into the bitstream packet, and then reconstructs the
vectors during decode.  Vorbis makes use of three different encoding
variants (numbered 0, 1 and 2) of the same basic vector encoding
abstraction.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id307154"></a>8.2. Residue format</h3></div></div></div><p>
Residue format partitions each vector in the vector bundle into chunks,
classifies each chunk, encodes the chunk classifications and finally
encodes the chunks themselves using the the specific VQ arrangement
defined for each selected classification.
The exact interleaving and partitioning vary by residue encoding number,
however the high-level process used to classify and encode the residue 
vector is the same in all three variants.</p><p>
A set of coded residue vectors are all of the same length.  High level
coding structure, ignoring for the moment exactly how a partition is
encoded and simply trusting that it is, is as follows:</p><p>
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Each vector is partitioned into multiple equal sized chunks
according to configuration specified.  If we have a vector size of
<span class="emphasis"><em>n</em></span>, a partition size <span class="emphasis"><em>residue_partition_size</em></span>, and a total
of <span class="emphasis"><em>ch</em></span> residue vectors, the total number of partitioned chunks
coded is <span class="emphasis"><em>n</em></span>/<span class="emphasis"><em>residue_partition_size</em></span>*<span class="emphasis"><em>ch</em></span>.  It is
important to note that the integer division truncates.  In the below
example, we assume an example <span class="emphasis"><em>residue_partition_size</em></span> of 8.</p></li><li><p>Each partition in each vector has a classification number that
specifies which of multiple configured VQ codebook setups are used to
decode that partition.  The classification numbers of each partition
can be thought of as forming a vector in their own right, as in the
illustration below.  Just as the residue vectors are coded in grouped
partitions to increase encoding efficiency, the classification vector
is also partitioned into chunks.  The integer elements of each scalar
in a classification chunk are built into a single scalar that
represents the classification numbers in that chunk.  In the below
example, the classification codeword encodes two classification
numbers.</p></li><li><p>The values in a residue vector may be encoded monolithically in a
single pass through the residue vector, but more often efficient
codebook design dictates that each vector is encoded as the additive
sum of several passes through the residue vector using more than one
VQ codebook.  Thus, each residue value potentially accumulates values
from multiple decode passes.  The classification value associated with
a partition is the same in each pass, thus the classification codeword
is coded only in the first pass.</p></li></ul></div><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="residue-pack.png" alt="[illustration of residue vector format]"></div></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id326310"></a>8.3. residue 0</h3></div></div></div><p>
Residue 0 and 1 differ only in the way the values within a residue
partition are interleaved during partition encoding (visually treated
as a black box--or cyan box or brown box--in the above figure).</p><p>
Residue encoding 0 interleaves VQ encoding according to the
dimension of the codebook used to encode a partition in a specific
pass.  The dimension of the codebook need not be the same in multiple
passes, however the partition size must be an even multiple of the
codebook dimension.</p><p>
As an example, assume a partition vector of size eight, to be encoded
by residue 0 using codebook sizes of 8, 4, 2 and 1:</p><pre class="programlisting">

            original residue vector: [ 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 ]

codebook dimensions = 8  encoded as: [ 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 ]

codebook dimensions = 4  encoded as: [ 0 2 4 6 ], [ 1 3 5 7 ]

codebook dimensions = 2  encoded as: [ 0 4 ], [ 1 5 ], [ 2 6 ], [ 3 7 ]

codebook dimensions = 1  encoded as: [ 0 ], [ 1 ], [ 2 ], [ 3 ], [ 4 ], [ 5 ], [ 6 ], [ 7 ]

</pre><p>
It is worth mentioning at this point that no configurable value in the
residue coding setup is restricted to a power of two.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id326344"></a>8.4. residue 1</h3></div></div></div><p>
Residue 1 does not interleave VQ encoding.  It represents partition
vector scalars in order.  As with residue 0, however, partition length
must be an integer multiple of the codebook dimension, although
dimension may vary from pass to pass.</p><p>
As an example, assume a partition vector of size eight, to be encoded
by residue 0 using codebook sizes of 8, 4, 2 and 1:</p><pre class="programlisting">

            original residue vector: [ 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 ]

Residue type two can be thought of as a variant of residue type 1.
Rather than encoding multiple passed-in vectors as in residue type 1,
the <span class="emphasis"><em>ch</em></span> passed in vectors of length <span class="emphasis"><em>n</em></span> are first
interleaved and flattened into a single vector of length
<span class="emphasis"><em>ch</em></span>*<span class="emphasis"><em>n</em></span>.  Encoding then proceeds as in type 1. Decoding is
as in type 1 with decode interleave reversed. If operating on a single
vector to begin with, residue type 1 and type 2 are equivalent.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="residue2.png" alt="[illustration of residue type 2]"></div></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id334939"></a>8.6. Residue decode</h3></div></div></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="id334945"></a>8.6.1. header decode</h4></div></div></div><p>

<code class="varname">[residue_begin]</code> and <code class="varname">[residue_end]</code> select the specific

vectors are zeroed.  Note that for residue type 2, these values as

vector, not the individual vectors before interleave.
<code class="varname">[residue_partition_size]</code> is as explained above,

Format 0 and 1 packet decode is identical except for specific
partition interleave.  Format 2 packet decode can be built out of the
format 1 decode process.  Thus we describe first the decode
infrastructure identical to all three formats.</p><p>
In addition to configuration information, the residue decode process
is passed the number of vectors in the submap bundle and a vector of
flags indicating if any of the vectors are not to be decoded.  If the
passed in number of vectors is 3 and vector number 1 is marked 'do not
decode', decode skips vector 1 during the decode loop.  However, even
'do not decode' vectors are allocated and zeroed.</p><p>
Depending on the values of <code class="varname">[residue_begin]</code> and
<code class="varname">[residue_end]</code>, it is obvious that the encoded
portion of a residue vector may be the entire possible residue vector
or some other strict subset of the actual residue vector size with
zero padding at either uncoded end.  However, it is also possible to
set <code class="varname">[residue_begin]</code> and
<code class="varname">[residue_end]</code> to specify a range partially or
wholly beyond the maximum vector size.  Before beginning residue
decode, limit <code class="varname">[residue_begin]</code> and
<code class="varname">[residue_end]</code> to the maximum possible vector size
as follows.  We assume that the number of vectors being encoded,
<code class="varname">[ch]</code> is provided by the higher level decoding
process.</p><pre class="programlisting">

This document describes using Ogg logical and physical transport
streams to encapsulate Vorbis compressed audio packet data into file
form.</p><p>
The <a href="#vorbis-spec-intro" title="1. Introduction and Description">Section 1, &#8220;Introduction and Description&#8221;</a> provides an overview of the construction
of Vorbis audio packets.</p><p>
The <a href="oggstream.html" target="_top">Ogg
bitstream overview</a> and <a href="framing.html" target="_top">Ogg logical
bitstream and framing spec</a> provide detailed descriptions of Ogg
transport streams. This specification document assumes a working
knowledge of the concepts covered in these named backround
documents.  Please read them first.</p><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="id336562"></a>1.1.1. Restrictions</h4></div></div></div><p>
The Ogg/Vorbis I specification currently dictates that Ogg/Vorbis
streams use Ogg transport streams in degenerate, unmultiplexed
form only. That is:

</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li>
  A meta-headerless Ogg file encapsulates the Vorbis I packets
 </li><li>
  The Ogg stream may be chained, i.e. contain multiple, contigous logical streams (links).
 </li><li>
  The Ogg stream must be unmultiplexed (only one stream, a Vorbis audio stream, per link)
 </li></ul></div><p>
</p><p>
This is not to say that it is not currently possible to multiplex
Vorbis with other media types into a multi-stream Ogg file.  At the
time this document was written, Ogg was becoming a popular container
for low-bitrate movies consisting of DiVX video and Vorbis audio.
However, a 'Vorbis I audio file' is taken to imply Vorbis audio
existing alone within a degenerate Ogg stream.  A compliant 'Vorbis
audio player' is not required to implement Ogg support beyond the
specific support of Vorbis within a degenrate ogg stream (naturally,
application authors are encouraged to support full multiplexed Ogg
handling).
</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="id330723"></a>1.1.2. MIME type</h4></div></div></div><p>
The correct MIME type of any Ogg file is <code class="literal">application/ogg</code>.
However, if a file is a Vorbis I audio file (which implies a
degenerate Ogg stream including only unmultiplexed Vorbis audio), the
mime type <code class="literal">audio/x-vorbis</code> is also allowed.</p></div></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id328095"></a>1.2. Encapsulation</h3></div></div></div><p>
Ogg encapsulation of a Vorbis packet stream is straightforward.</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li>
  The first Vorbis packet (the identification header), which
  uniquely identifies a stream as Vorbis audio, is placed alone in the
  first page of the logical Ogg stream.  This results in a first Ogg
  page of exactly 58 bytes at the very beginning of the logical stream.
</li><li>
  This first page is marked 'beginning of stream' in the page flags.
</li><li>
  The second and third vorbis packets (comment and setup
  headers) may span one or more pages beginning on the second page of
  the logical stream.  However many pages they span, the third header
  packet finishes the page on which it ends.  The next (first audio) packet
  must begin on a fresh page.
</li><li>
  The granule position of these first pages containing only headers is zero.
</li><li>
  The first audio packet of the logical stream begins a fresh Ogg page.
</li><li>
  Packets are placed into ogg pages in order until the end of stream.
</li><li>
  The last page is marked 'end of stream' in the page flags.
</li><li>
  Vorbis packets may span page boundaries.
</li><li>
  The granule position of pages containing Vorbis audio is in units
  of PCM audio samples (per channel; a stereo stream's granule position
  does not increment at twice the speed of a mono stream).
</li><li>
  The granule position of a page represents the end PCM sample
  position of the last packet <span class="emphasis"><em>completed</em></span> on that page.
  A page that is entirely spanned by a single packet (that completes on a
  subsequent page) has no granule position, and the granule position is
  set to '-1'.
</li><li><p>
    The granule (PCM) position of the first page need not indicate
    that the stream started at position zero.  Although the granule
    position belongs to the last completed packet on the page and a 
    valid granule position must be positive, by
    inference it may indicate that the PCM position of the beginning
    of audio is positive or negative.
  </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="circle"><li>
        A positive starting value simply indicates that this stream begins at
        some positive time offset, potentially within a larger

        of broadcast stream.

        A negative value indicates that
        output samples preceeding time zero should be discarded during
        decoding; this technique is used to allow sample-granularity
        editing of the stream start time of already-encoded Vorbis
        streams.  The number of samples to be discarded must not exceed 
        the overlap-add span of the first two audio packets.
    </li></ul></div><p>
    In both of these cases in which the initial audio PCM starting
    offset is nonzero, the second finished audio packet must flush the
    page on which it appears and the third packet begin a fresh page.
    This allows the decoder to always be able to perform PCM position
    adjustments before needing to return any PCM data from synthesis, 
    resulting in correct positioning information without any aditional
    seeking logic.

    Failure to do so should, at worst, cause a
    decoder implementation to return incorrect positioning information
    for seeking operations at the very beginning of the stream.
  </p></div></li><li>
  A granule position on the final page in a stream that indicates
  less audio data than the final packet would normally return is used to
  end the stream on other than even frame boundaries.  The difference
  between the actual available data returned and the declared amount
  indicates how many trailing samples to discard from the decoding
  process.
