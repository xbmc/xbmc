             Secure Socket Layer (SSL) Overview<br /></h1>
          </div>

          <div class="guideSection">
            <p>Appweb supports the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol for
            authenticating systems and encrypting data. Use of this protocol
            enables secure data transmission to and from clients in a
            standards-based manner. The Secure Sockets Layer protocol is a
            protocol layer which may be placed between a reliable
            connection-oriented network layer protocol (e.g. TCP/IP) and the
            application protocol layer (e.g. HTTP). SSL provides for secure
            communication between client and server by allowing mutual
            authentication, the use of digital signatures for integrity, and
            encryption for privacy.</p>

            <p>This following document explains SSL and how to configure SSL
            in Appweb. It has heavily borrowed from the Apache Documentation.
            Many thanks to the fine folks at Apache for this excellent base
            material and for Frederick Hirsch who authored quite a bit of the
            original material.<br /></p>

            <p>If you have a good understanding of SSL and now you want to
            configure SSL for Appweb, you may wish to skip the background and
            read immediately how to setup <a href="#sslOverview">SSL for
            Appweb</a>.<br /></p>

            Cryptographic Techniques</h2>

            <p>Understanding SSL requires an understanding of cryptographic
            algorithms, message digest functions (aka. one-way or hash
            functions), and digital signatures. The following section
            provides a brief introduction to the cryptographic foundations of
            SSL. If you are already familiar with this material, please skip
            forward to the <a href="#sslOverview">SSL</a> section.</p>

            <h3>Cryptographic Algorithms</h3>

            <p>Consider the example of Alice who wants to send a message to
            her bank to transfer some money. She would like the message to be
            private, since it will include information such as her account
            number and transfer amount. One solution is to use a
            cryptographic algorithm, a technique that would transform her
            message into an encrypted form, unreadable except by those it is
            intended for. Once in this form, the message may only be
            interpreted through the use of a secret key. Without the key the
            message is useless: good cryptographic algorithms make it so
            difficult for intruders to decode the original text that it isn't
            worth their effort.</p>

            <p>There are two categories of cryptographic algorithms:
            conventional and public key.</p>

            <h4><a name="symmetricCryptography" id=
            "symmetricCryptography"></a>Symmetric Cryptography</h4>

            <p>Symmetric cryptography, requires the sender and receiver to
            share a key: a secret piece of information that may be used to
            encrypt or decrypt a message. If this key is secret, then nobody
            other than the sender or receiver may read the message. If Alice
            and the bank know a secret key, then they may send each other
            private messages. The task of privately choosing a key before
            communicating, however, can be problematic.</p>

            <h4><a name="publicKeyCryptography" id=
            "publicKeyCryptography"></a>Public Key Cryptography</h4>

            <p>Public key cryptography also known as asymmetric cryptography,
            solves the key exchange problem by defining an algorithm which
            uses two keys, each of which may be used to encrypt a message. If
            one key is used to encrypt a message then the other must be used
            to decrypt it. This makes it possible to receive secure messages
            by simply publishing one key (the public key) and keeping the
            other secret (the private key).</p>

            <p>Anyone may encrypt a message using the public key, but only
            the owner of the private key will be able to read it. In this
            way, you may send private messages to the owner of a key-pair
            (the bank), by encrypting it using their public key. Only the
            bank will be able to decrypt it.</p>

            <h3><a name="messageDigests" id="messageDigests"></a>Message
            Digests</h3>

            <p>Although Alice may encrypt her message to make it private,
            there is still a concern that someone might modify her original
            message or substitute it with a different one, in order to
            transfer the money to themselves, for instance. One way of
            guaranteeing the integrity of Alice's message is to create a
            concise summary of her message and send this to the bank as well.
            Upon receipt of the message, the bank creates its own summary and
            compares it with the one Alice sent. If they agree then the
            message was received intact.</p>

            <p>A summary such as this is called a <dfn>message digest</dfn>,
            <em>one-way function</em> or <em>hash function</em>. Message
            digests are used to create short, fixed-length representations of
            longer, variable-length messages. Digest algorithms are designed
            to produce unique digests for different messages. Message digests
            are designed to make it too difficult to determine the message
            from the digest, and also impossible to find two different
            messages which create the same digest -- thus eliminating the
            possibility of substituting one message for another while
            maintaining the same digest.</p>

            <p>Another challenge that Alice faces is finding a way to send
            the digest to the bank securely; when this is achieved, the
            integrity of the associated message is assured. One way to do
            this is to include the digest in a digital signature.</p>

            <h3><a name="digitalSignatures" id=
            "digitalSignatures"></a>Digital Signatures</h3>

            <p>When Alice sends a message to the bank, the bank needs to
            ensure that the message is really from her, so an intruder does
            not request a transaction involving her account. A <em>digital
            signature</em>, created by Alice and included with the message,
            serves this purpose.</p>

            <p>Digital signatures are created by encrypting a digest of the
            message, and other information (such as a sequence number) with
            the sender's private key. Though anyone may <em>decrypt</em> the
            signature using the public key, only the signer knows the private
            key. This means that only they may have signed it. Including the
            digest in the signature means the signature is only good for that
            message; it also ensures the integrity of the message since no
            one can change the digest and still sign it.</p>

            <p>To guard against interception and reuse of the signature by an
            intruder at a later date, the signature contains a unique
            sequence number. This protects the bank from a fraudulent claim
            from Alice that she did not send the message -- only she could
            have signed it (non-repudiation).</p>

            <h2><a name="certificates" id="certificates"></a> <a href=
            "#top"><img src="../../../images/upArrow.gif" class="nav" height=
            "16" width="16" /></a> Certificates</h2>

            <p>Although Alice could have sent a private message to the bank,
            signed it, and ensured the integrity of the message, she still
            needs to be sure that she is really communicating with the bank.
            This means that she needs to be sure that the public key she is
            using corresponds to the bank's private key. Similarly, the bank
            also needs to verify that the message signature really
            corresponds to Alice's signature.</p>

            <p>If each party has a certificate which validates the other's
            identity, confirms the public key, and is signed by a trusted
            agency, then they both will be assured that they are
            communicating with whom they think they are. Such a trusted
            agency is called a <em>Certificate Authority</em>, and
            certificates are used for authentication.</p>

            <h3>Certificate Contents</h3>

            <p>A certificate associates a public key with the real identity
            of an individual, server, or other entity, known as the subject.
            As shown in <a href="#table1">Table 1</a>, information about the
            subject includes identifying information (the distinguished
            name), and the public key. It also includes the identification
            and signature of the Certificate Authority that issued the
            certificate, and the period of time during which the certificate
            is valid. It may have additional information (or extensions) as
            well as administrative information for the Certificate
            Authority's use, such as a serial number.</p>

            <p>A distinguished name is used to provide an identity in a
            specific context -- for instance, an individual might have a
            personal certificate as well as one for their identity as an
            employee. Distinguished names are defined by the X.509 standard,
            which defines the fields, field names, and abbreviations used to
            refer to the fields (see <a href="#table2">Table 2</a>).</p>

            </table>

            <p>A Certificate Authority may define a policy specifying which
            distinguished field names are optional, and which are required.
            It may also place requirements upon the field contents, as may
            users of certificates. As an example, a Netscape browser requires
            that the Common Name for a certificate representing a server has
            a name which matches a wildcard pattern for the domain name of
            that server, such as <code>*.snakeoil.com</code>.</p>

            <p>The binary format of a certificate is defined using the ASN.1
            notation. This notation defines how to specify the contents, and
            encoding rules define how this information is translated into
            binary form. The binary encoding of the certificate is defined
            using Distinguished Encoding Rules (DER), which are based on the
            more general Basic Encoding Rules (BER). For those transmissions
            which cannot handle binary, the binary form may be translated
            into an ASCII form by using Base64 encoding. This encoded version
            is called PEM encoded (the name comes from "Privacy Enhanced
            Mail"), when placed between begin and end delimiter lines as
            illustrated in the following example.</p>

            <p>A Certificate Authority may also issue a certificate for
            another Certificate Authority. When examining a certificate,
            Alice may need to examine the certificate of the issuer, for each
            parent Certificate Authority, until reaching one which she has
            confidence in. She may decide to trust only certificates with a
            limited chain of issuers, to reduce her risk of a "bad"
            certificate in the chain.</p>

            <h4>Creating a Root-Level CA</h4>

            <p>As noted earlier, each certificate requires an issuer to
            assert the validity of the identity of the certificate subject,
            up to the top-level Certificate Authority (CA). This presents a
            problem: Since this is who vouches for the certificate of the
            top-level authority, which has no issuer? In this unique case,
            the certificate is "self-signed", so the issuer of the
            certificate is the same as the subject. As a result, one must
            exercise extra care in trusting a self-signed certificate. The
            wide publication of a public key by the root authority reduces
            the risk in trusting this key -- it would be obvious if someone
            else publicized a key claiming to be the authority. Browsers are
            preconfigured to trust well-known certificate authorities.</p>

            <p>A number of companies, such as <a href=
            "http://www.thawte.com/">Thawte</a> and <a href=
            "http://www.verisign.com/">VeriSign</a> have established
            themselves as Certificate Authorities. These companies provide
            the following services:</p>

            <ul>
              <li>Verifying certificate requests</li>

              <li>Processing certificate requests</li>

              <li>Issuing and managing certificates</li>
            </ul>

            <p>It is also possible to create your own Certificate Authority.
            Although risky in the Internet environment, it may be useful
            within an Intranet where the organization can easily verify the
            identities of individuals and servers.</p>

            <h4>Certificate Management</h4>

            <p>Establishing a Certificate Authority is a responsibility which
            requires a solid administrative, technical, and management
            framework. Certificate Authorities not only issue certificates,
            they also manage them -- that is, they determine how long
            certificates are valid, they renew them, and they keep lists of
            certificates that have already been issued but are no longer
            valid (Certificate Revocation Lists, or CRLs). Say Alice is
            entitled to a certificate as an employee of a company. Say too,
            that the certificate needs to be revoked when Alice leaves the
            company. Since certificates are objects that get passed around,
            it is impossible to tell from the certificate alone that it has
            been revoked. When examining certificates for validity,
            therefore, it is necessary to contact the issuing Certificate
            Authority to check CRLs -- this is not usually an automated part
            of the process.</p>

            <h3>Note</h3>

            <p>If you use a Certificate Authority that is not configured into
            browsers by default, it is necessary to load the Certificate
            Authority certificate into the browser, enabling the browser to
            validate server certificates signed by that Certificate
            Authority. Doing so may be dangerous, since once loaded, the
            browser will accept all certificates signed by that Certificate
            Authority.</p>

          </table>

          <p>There are a number of versions of the SSL protocol, as shown in
          <a href="#table4">Table 4</a>. As noted there, one of the benefits
          in SSL 3.0 is that it adds support of certificate chain loading.
          This feature allows a server to pass a server certificate along
          with issuer certificates to the browser. Chain loading also permits
          the browser to validate the server certificate, even if Certificate
          Authority certificates are not installed for the intermediate
          issuers, since they are included in the certificate chain. SSL 3.0
          is the basis for the Transport Layer Security protocol standard,
          currently in development by the Internet Engineering Task Force
          (IETF).</p>

          <h3>Session Establishment</h3>

          <p>The SSL session is established by following a handshake sequence
          between client and server. This sequence may vary, depending on
          whether the server is configured to provide a server certificate or
          request a client certificate. Though cases exist where additional
          handshake steps are required for management of cipher information,
          this article summarizes one common scenario: see the SSL
          specification for the full range of possibilities.</p>

          <h3>Note</h3>

          <p>Once an SSL session has been established it may be reused, thus
          avoiding the performance penalty of repeating the many steps needed
          to start a session. For this the server assigns each SSL session a
          unique session identifier which is cached in the server and which
          the client can use on forthcoming connections to reduce the
          handshake (until the session identifier expires in the cache of the
          server).</p>

          <p class="figure">The elements of the handshake sequence, as used
          by the client and server, are listed below:</p>

          <ol>
            <li>
              <p>Negotiate the Cipher Suite to be used during data
              transfer</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>Establish and share a session key between client and
              server</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>Optionally authenticate the server to the client</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>Optionally authenticate the client to the server</p>
            </li>
          </ol>

          <p>The first step, Cipher Suite Negotiation, allows the client and
          server to choose a Cipher Suite supportable by both of them. The
          SSL3.0 protocol specification defines 31 Cipher Suites. A Cipher
          Suite is defined by the following components:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>Key Exchange Method</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>Cipher for Data Transfer</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>Message Digest for creating the Message Authentication Code
              (MAC)</p>
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>These three elements are described in the sections that
          follow.</p>

          <h3>Key Exchange Method</h3>

          <p>The key exchange method defines how the shared secret symmetric
          cryptography key used for application data transfer will be agreed
          upon by client and server. SSL 2.0 uses RSA key exchange only,
          while SSL 3.0 supports a choice of key exchange algorithms
          including the RSA key exchange when certificates are used, and
          Diffie-Hellman key exchange for exchanging keys without
          certificates and without prior communication between client and
          server.</p>

          <p>One variable in the choice of key exchange methods is digital
          signatures -- whether or not to use them, and if so, what kind of
          signatures to use. Signing with a private key provides assurance
          against a man-in-the-middle-attack during the information exchange
          used in generating the shared key.</p>

          <h3>Cipher for Data Transfer</h3>

          <p>SSL uses the conventional cryptography algorithm (symmetric
          cryptography) described earlier for encrypting messages in a
          session. There are nine choices, including the choice to perform no
          encryption:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>No encryption</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>Stream Ciphers</p>

              <ul>
                <li>
                  <p>RC4 with 40-bit keys</p>
                </li>

                <li>
                  <p>RC4 with 128-bit keys</p>
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>CBC Block Ciphers</p>

              <ul>
                <li>
                  <p>RC2 with 40 bit key</p>
                </li>

                <li>
                  <p>DES with 40 bit key</p>
                </li>

                <li>
                  <p>DES with 56 bit key</p>
                </li>

                <li>
                  <p>Triple-DES with 168 bit key</p>
                </li>

                <li>
                  <p>Idea (128 bit key)</p>
                </li>

                <li>
                  <p>Fortezza (96 bit key)</p>
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>Here "CBC" refers to Cipher Block Chaining, which means that a
          portion of the previously encrypted cipher text is used in the
          encryption of the current block. "DES" refers to the Data
          Encryption Standard, which has a number of variants (including
          DES40 and 3DES_EDE). "Idea" is one of the best and
          cryptographically strongest available algorithms, and "RC2" is a
          proprietary algorithm from RSA DSI.</p>

          <h3>Digest Function</h3>

          <p>The choice of digest function determines how a digest is created
          from a record unit. SSL supports the following:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>No digest (Null choice)</li>

            <li>MD5, a 128-bit hash</li>

            <li>Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA-1), a 160-bit hash</li>
          </ul>

          <p>The message digest is used to create a Message Authentication
          Code (MAC) which is encrypted with the message to provide integrity
          and to prevent against replay attacks.</p>

          <h3>Handshake Sequence Protocol</h3>

          <p>The handshake sequence uses three protocols:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>The <dfn>SSL Handshake Protocol</dfn> for performing the
            client and server SSL session establishment.</li>

            <li>The <dfn>SSL Change Cipher Spec Protocol</dfn> for actually
            establishing agreement on the Cipher Suite for the session.</li>

            <li>The <dfn>SSL Alert Protocol</dfn> for conveying SSL error
            messages between client and server.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>These protocols, as well as application protocol data, are
          encapsulated in the <dfn>SSL Record Protocol</dfn>. An encapsulated
          protocol is transferred as data by the lower layer protocol, which
          does not examine the data. The encapsulated protocol has no
          knowledge of the underlying protocol.</p>

          <p>The encapsulation of SSL control protocols by the record
          protocol means that if an active session is renegotiated the
          control protocols will be transmitted securely. If there were no
          session before, then the Null cipher suite is used, which means
          there is no encryption and messages have no integrity digests until
          the session has been established.</p>

          <h3>Data Transfer</h3>

          <p>The SSL Record Protocol is used to transfer application and SSL
          Control data between the client and server, possibly fragmenting
          this data into smaller units, or combining multiple higher level
          protocol data messages into single units. It may compress, attach
          digest signatures, and encrypt these units before transmitting them
          using the underlying reliable transport protocol (Note: currently
          all major SSL implementations lack support for compression).</p>

          <h3 class="figure">Securing HTTP Communication</h3>

          <p>One common use of SSL is to secure Web HTTP communication
          between a browser and a web server. This case does not preclude the
          use of non-secured HTTP. The secure version is mainly plain HTTP
          over SSL (named HTTPS), but with one major difference: it uses the
          URL scheme <code>https</code> rather than <code>http</code> and a
          different server port (by default 443). Appweb as installed will
          use port 4443 which may be changed by editing the appweb.conf
          configuration file.</p>
