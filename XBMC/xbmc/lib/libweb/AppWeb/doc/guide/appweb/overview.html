             Mbedthis Appweb&#8482; Overview</h1>
          </div>

          <div class="guideSection">
            Mbedthis Appweb is the industry's first embeddable HTTP web
            server that has been designed from the start with security in
            mind. It is a fast, high functionality, small-footprint,
            standards based embedded web server specifically designed for use
            by embedded applications and devices.

            <h2><a name="whyEmbed" id="whyEmbed"></a> <a href=
            "#top"><img class="nav" src="../../images/upArrow.gif" height=
            "16" width="16" /></a> Why Embed a Web Server?</h2>There are two
            ways to implement a HTTP web server.<br />

            <ul>
              <li>
                <p>Create a web application to run with an Enterprise class
                web server such as Apache. This presentation layer
                application then communicates with your "logic" application
                as required.</p>
              </li>

              <li>
                <p>Embed a HTTP web server directly in your application so it
                becomes a HTTP server itself.</p>
              </li>
            </ul>Conventional wisdom has stressed the separation of
            presentation from logic and this is a good axiom. However, it
            should be a logical separation and not necessarily a physical
            separation. In some cases, a physical separation is ideal and it
            can often help to scale-out a large site when used with load
            balancing. In other cases, the simplicity and performance gains
            from embedding a web server directly in an application or device
            make direct embedding the preferred choice. Both approaches are
            legitimate. Mbedthis Appweb aims to be the best embeddable HTTP
            server.<br />
            <br />
            There are many reasons to embed a Web Server. Some examples
            are:<br />

            <ul>
              <li>
                <p>You want to ship a device appliance and it must be web
                manageable for all functions.</p>
              </li>

              <li>
                <p>You want to ship evaluation copies of your application
                with a web user interface, but you don't want users to have
                to modify their enterprise web server configuration just for
                a trial.</p>
              </li>

              <li>
                <p>You want to web-enable an existing application as quickly
                as possible and you don't want the complexity of creating a
                separate web application.</p>
              </li>

              <li>You want to simplify the deployment of your application so
              it can be secured and administered at one point. You don't want
              to separately manage the web presentation and the back-end
              application.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2><a name="whoEmbeds" id="whoEmbeds"></a> <a href=
            "#top"><img class="nav" src="../../images/upArrow.gif" height=
            "16" width="16" /></a> Who Embeds Web Servers?</h2><br />
            There are two classes of users for Appweb: Enterprise application
            developers and Device builders and they are riding two key
            trends:<br />

            <ul>
              <li>Devices and appliances are expected to be web
              manageable</li>

              <li>
                <p>Enterprise customers who want applications with web based
                user interfaces</p>
              </li>
            </ul>Should embedding a HTTP server be the right option for you,
            there are numerous benefits in doing so:<br />

            <ul>
              <li>
                <p>Simpler design (one process, no IPC, single protocol)</p>
              </li>

              <li>
                <p>Easier to secure</p>
              </li>

              <li>
                <p>Less code (means less bugs)</p>
              </li>

              <li>
                <p>Much easier to create dynamic web content</p>
              </li>
            </ul>

            "#top"><img class="nav" src="../../images/upArrow.gif" height=
            "16" width="16" /></a>A Web Server is a Web Server,
            Right?<br /></h2>An embedded web server has a different set of
            design goals compared with those of an enterprise web server such
            as Apache. While both servers receive and respond to the standard
            HTTP protocol, the design goals and core processing architectures
            choices are considerably different. Furthermore, the resource
            demands these web servers impose on a system may be very
            different.<br />
            <br />
            Enterprise web servers typically assume that <span class=
            "c2">they</span> are the most important application on the system
            and often run on a dedicated system. It is acceptable for them to
            scale to consume available resources to serve incoming requests.
            In contrast, Embedded web servers assume they are secondary to
            the essential functions an application or device must perform. As
            such, embedded web servers must minimize their resource demands
            and must be deterministic in the load they place on a
            system.<br />
            <br />
            The key design goals of embedded web servers and Appweb in
            particular are to be:<br />

            <ul>
              <li>
                <p>Easily embeddable in applications and devices</p>
              </li>

              <li>
                <p>Easy to configure and administer</p>

                <p>Small memory footprint</p>

              <li>
                <p>Deterministic demand on system resources</p>

                <p>No compromise on features</p>

            <p>The core Appweb HTTP server has been carefully designed to be
            deterministic in its use of system resources while retaining high
            performance and minimal footprint. It does this leveraging the
            following features:<br /></p>

            <ul>
              <li>
                <p>Portable runtime layer to isolate platform

            "nav" src="../../images/upArrow.gif" height="16" width=
            "16" /></a> Modes of Operation</h2>The Mbedthis Appweb product is
            more than just a stand-alone HTTP server. The product includes
            this base functionality, but it also exposes components so that
            you may embed the core HTTP server and HTTP client functionality
            directly in your applications.<br />
            <br />
            For applications, embedding the HTTP server in the application
            greatly simplifies deployment as there is no separate web
            application to deploy. For devices, either running a stand-alone
            server or embedding the server in the device application will
            work effectively.<br />

            Appweb as a stand-alone server or when embedding, you can create
            web user interfaces using several innovative Appweb technologies
            and existing standard technologies<br />

            <ul>
              <li>
                <p>Server-side JavaScript via EJScript<span class=
                "c2">&#8482;</span></p>

              <li>
                <p>Embedded Gateway Interface&#8482;</p>
              </li>

              <li>
                <p>Open Modular Architecture</p>
              </li>

              <li>
                <p>Common Gateway Interface</p>
              </li>
            </ul>The Appweb server runs as a stand-alone program. On Windows,
            it runs as a system service and on Linux/Unix it runs as a system
            daemon.<br />

            <h3><a name="javaScript" id="javaScript"></a>Server-side
            JavaScript</h3>JavaScript or ECMAScript (ECMA-262) has typically
            been implemented in the client. However, it is ideally suited for
            embedded use on the server. Appweb supports a subset of
            ECMAScript called EJScript that is fast and compact.<br />

            <h3><a name="esp" id="esp"></a>Embedded Server Pages
            (ESP)</h3>Embedded Server Pages are server side JavaScripted HTML
            pages that allow direct binding between the JavaScript procedures
            and logic routines in your application.<br />
            <br />
            The Embedded Server Pages technology remedies these shortcomings
            by allowing you to use page layout programs such as Dreamweaver
            while still retaining the ability to generate dynamic content
            within the page via server-side JavaScripting.<br />

            <h3><a name="egi" id="egi"></a>Embedded Gateway Interface
            (EGI)</h3>

            <p>The Embedded Gateway Interface is a modern replacement for the
            Common Gateway Interface (CGI). Using CGI for form data suffers
            from many of the same deficiencies it exhibits when it is used to
            generate page data. In addition, it provides a very low level
            interface that does not assist the developer when decoding query
            or posted data.</p>

            <p>The Embedded Gateway Interface is one of a set of modern
            replacements for the venerable Common Gateway Interface (CGI).
            CGI suffers from several deficiencies that make it a poor choice
            for creating dynamic user interfaces in embedded
            applications:</p>

            <ul>
              <li>
                <p>Cannot view the page layout at design time</p>
              </li>

              <li>
                <p>Very slow</p>
              </li>

              <li>
                <p>Large demand on system resources</p>
              </li>

              <li>
                <p>Additional programs and interfaces need securing</p>
              </li>
            </ul>The Embedded Gateway Interface remedies these shortcomings
            by allowing an equivalent of in-process CGI. Form URLs may be
            bound directly to EGI code routines that will be called when the
            form is posted. Appweb further assists by decoding query
            arguments and providing hashed lookup to all environment data
            variables.<br />

            <h3><a name="modular" id="modular"></a>Open Modular
            Architecture</h3>Appweb supports dynamically loadable modules so
            that new content handlers, scripting engines and page generation
            environments can be easily added. The existing mechanisms: ESP
            and EGI have been developed as loadable modules so that they are
            only loaded if required. Scripting engines such as PHP have also
            been created as loadable modules.<br />

            <h3><a name="cgi" id="cgi"></a>Common Gateway Interface
            (CGI)</h3>Should you need to support existing code bases that use
            CGI, Appweb provides a high performance CGI implementation.<br />

            embedding the Appweb HTTP server in a device or&nbsp;application,
            all the features of the stand alone Appweb server are available.
            The required SSL, Authentication, Embedded Server Pages, Embedded
            Gateway Interface, CGI and other dynamic modules will be loaded
            into the application as required.<br />
            <br />
            To embed the Appweb HTTP server or client in an application is
            easy and requires from 10 lines of code to integrate and
            activate. Because Appweb is configured primarily by using an
            Apache style ASCII configuration file, initialization by code is
            not necessary. This also eases administration as the server
            configuration may be modified in the field if required.<br />
            <br />
            To make Appweb easy to embed, it supports a wide variety of
            <a href="programmers/paradigms.html">Programming Paradigms</a>.
            This includes support for C and C++, single and multithreaded
            programs and a variety of different event mechanisms.<br />

            <h3>Threading Model</h3>The Appweb HTTP server can run either
            single threaded or multithreaded and the threading mode can be
            selected at run-time by your application. Further, you can set
            the number of threads to be used by Appweb depending on the
            anticipated scale of your application.<br />
            <br />
            Appweb can fully expose its event loop if needed so that it can
            be integrated with existing application event mechanisms. It
            supports the following event processing mechanisms:<br />

            <ul>
              <li>
                <p>Polled</p>
              </li>

              <li>
                <p>POSIX select</p>
              </li>

              <li>
                <p>Service thread</p>
              </li>

              <li>
                <p>Windows messages<br /></p>
              </li>
            </ul><span class="c3">Debugging Support<br /></span> The Appweb
            HTTP server includes a powerful debug logging facility and is
            fully instrumented to log trace information. This can be
            invaluable in debugging ESP code logic or new Appweb handlers
            that you may have written.<br />

            <h3>Samples</h3>An extensive suite of samples is provided. See
            the <a href="programmers/samples/index.html">Programming
            Samples</a> document for details..<br />

            <h2><a name="security" id="security"></a> <a href=
            "#top"><img class="nav" src="../../images/upArrow.gif" height=
            "16" width="16" /></a> Security</h2>Most HTTP servers have become
            more secure by a painful process of discovery. While it is no
            guarantee, developing a HTTP server to be secure by design is
            easier than trying to engineer security in after the fact.
            Securing embedded HTTP servers is even more difficult as it must
            be done without increasing memory footprint or damaging
            performance.<br />

            <h3>Mbedthis Portable Runtime (MPR)</h3>Appweb has been designed
            to be secure from the foundation by using the Mbedthis Portable
            Runtime (MPR). The MPR is a cross-platform layer that permits
            over 97% of the Appweb code to be portable. It includes a safe
            string and buffer handling module to help the eliminate buffer
            overflows that have plagued so many products. It also warns when
            any unsafe (traditional) C API functions are used.<br />

            <h3>Sandboxing</h3>The Appweb HTTP server closely controls its
            use of system resources via a technique known as "sandboxing".
            This means running the web-server within tightly controlled
            limits so that script errors or web server bugs will not
            compromise system operation. Appweb has also been hardened
            against several common denial of service attacks.<br />
            <br />
            Appweb can be configured to:<br />

            <ul>
              <li>
                <p>Preallocate memory and not grow beyond predefined memory
                limits</p>
              </li>

              <li>
                <p>Reject requests that are too large</p>
              </li>

              <li>
                <p>Reject URLs that are too long</p>
              </li>

              <li>
                <p>Run single-threaded or use a pool of reusable threads to
                service requests</p>
              </li>

              <li>
                <p>Be run by a designated user account or user group</p>
              </li>
            </ul>To build on this foundation, Appweb provides Secure Sockets
            Layer and Digest authentication.<br />
