GoAhead WebServer 2.1.7 Release Notes
=====================================

Release Date:
   01 Oct 2003

Added support for the Mocana SSL Toolkit
----------------------------------------

Description:
   Added support for Mocana Corporation's embedded SSL server

Changes to ``dbSearchString()``
-------------------------------

Description:
   
   Pass ``DB_CASE_INSENSITIVE`` as the "flags" argument to
   dbSearchString() to force a case-insensitive search.
   

Use ``memcpy()`` when converting to/from Unicode
------------------------------------------------
Description:
   The functions ``uniToAsc()`` and ``ascToUni()`` were using the relatively
   slow ``strncpy()`` runtime library function. 

Fix:
   A new preprocessor macro ``kUseMemcopy`` was added to ``misc.c``, and both
   functions were recoded to use ``memcpy()`` when that macro is defined.
   Remove the definition to revert to the earlier code, using ``strncpy()``.


Bug when using UTF-8 encoded text inside ASP/ejScript blocks   
---------------------------------------------------------------

Description:
   When reading ASP code containing UTF-8 encoded source text, any characters
   encountered having a value > 127 were treated as an error by the parser.

Fix:
   The ring queue code in ``ringq.c`` was modified so that it can correctly
   handle any character it encounters by casting to unsigned char before
   casting back to signed integer.

Wrong error code on invalid password
------------------------------------

Description:
   The WebServer was sending back an inappropriate error code when it received
   an incorrect password.

Fix:
   Changed error code returned from ``405`` to ``401``. (Thanks to Jay
   Chalfant).

Windows CE.NET   
-----------------

Description:
   Removed "compatibility functions" that are directly supported in Windows
   CE.NET.

LYNX ``Makefile``
-----------------

Description:
   Corrected problem in LYNX Makefile that prevented OpenSSL from being linked
   in correctly.

GoAhead WebServer 2.1.6 Release Notes
=====================================
Release Date:
   25 Mar 2003

``NULL`` pointer crash in ``websSafeUrl()``
-------------------------------------------

Description:
   Passing a NULL pointer into the ``websSafeUrl()`` function (as would happen
   when the server is processing an invalid URL) crashes the server.

Fix:
   Code modified to check for NULL pointer before performing any string
   operations.


GoAhead WebServer 2.1.5 Release Notes
=====================================
Release Date:
   19 Mar 2003



``bopen()`` failure mode
------------------------



Description:
   New failure behavior for ``bopen()`` (see ``balloc.c``)

Fix:
   Changed failure behavior of the bopen() function (suggested by Simon
   Byholm).  If the malloc() request fails, we reset the bopenCount
   variable, and thus allow the client code to reattempt the open with
   a smaller memory request.

   
Windows 95/98/ME ``AUX`` Denial of Service
------------------------------------------


  
Description:
   When running on Windows 95/98/ME, URLs requested with path components
   matching a set of reserved DOS device names caused the WebServer to crash.
   
   The names that cause the crash are::

      aux
      con
      nul
      clock$
      config$

   
   

Fix:
   Code added to the ``websValidateUrl()`` function to check the contents of
   the parsed URL against the list of prohibited names. If any of those names
   are present in the parsed URL, the URL is rejected as invalid.

   The code that checks for these prohibited pathname components checks for
   them in the form of either::

      http://<<server address>>/aux

   or::

      http://<<server address>>/aux:

   where any non-alphanumeric character following one of the prohibited names
   will cause the URL request to be rejected.


404 Cross-site Scripting Exploit   
-----------------------------------


Description:
   Malicious users could request an invalid URL containing embedded JavaScript
   code that would be executed in the user's browser.

Fix:
   404 (and other error messages) returned by the WebServer no longer display
   the invalid URL.

Long URL Overflow Crash
-----------------------


Description:
   URLs containing more than 64 levels of path components caused the WebServer
   to crash, entering a buffer overflow condition.

Fix:
   The WebServer now keeps track of the depth as it validates the URL. URLs
   that are too long are now rejected with an error message.

Incorrect Error Code in ``security.c``
--------------------------------------


Description:
   Pages assigned an access level of ``AM_NONE`` should return an error code
   of 404 instead of 400 when an attempt it made to access them.

Fix:
   Error code corrected.

Pragma Code for RISC Architectures   
-------------------------------------


Description:
   A pragma was not set correctly when compiling for SPARC machines.

Fix:
   Code added to ``uemf.h``::
      
      #ifdef sparc
      # define __NO_PACK
      #endif /* sparc */




   
GoAhead® WebServer 2.1.4 Release Notes 
=======================================
      
Release Date:
   17 Oct 2002




Fixed vulnerability to malicious code in ``webs.c``
---------------------------------------------------



Summary:
    There were two vulnerabilities in ``webs.c``. Sending a POST message
    with a content-length but no data resulted in an attempt to perform
    a ``strlen()`` on a NULL pointer (thanks to Richard Cullen). Also,
    sending an HTTP POST message with a Content-Length header indicating
    that the length of the posted data was less than zero would crash
    the server (thanks to Auriemma Luigi).

Fix:
   Code errors corrected.
    
   

https:// bug in security handler
--------------------------------

  
Summary:
    The ``websSecurityHandler()`` function was performing a logical
    OR: (``flags | WEBS_SECURE``) instead of a logical AND (``flags &
    WEBS_SECURE``), leading to incorrect results (thanks to "Dhanwa T").

Fix:
      Code errors corrected.
    
   

Fixed vulnerability to malicious code in sockGen.c
--------------------------------------------------

  
Summary:
    At line 613 of ``sockGen.c``, the return value of the function
    ``socketInputBuffered()`` was being discarded, leading to incorrect
    behavior in some cases. (Thanks to Richard Cullen)

Fix:
      Code errors corrected.
    
   
Bug Fixes for Version 2.1.3
===========================


Directory Traversal Exploit 
----------------------------

  
Summary:
      Several sources have reported that requesting an URL with URL-encoded
      backslashes (%5C) allow accessing files located outside the server's
      designated web root. This should only have been possible on Windows, as
      URL-encoded forward slashes (%2F) were already being handled correctly.

Fix:
      Modified ``default.c`` so that any backslash characters created as
      part of decoding the URL string are converted (in place) to forward
      slashes. The pre-existing directory-traversal detection code then
      rejects the bad URL as expected.
    
   
MIME type for external JavaScript files 
----------------------------------------

  
Summary:
      The WebServer would not serve external JavaScript files (``*.js``)
      correctly.


Fix:
    modified ``mime.c`` to associate ``.js`` files with the MIME
    type ``application/x-javascript``.
   
   
Bug in If-Modified-Since parsing
--------------------------------

  
Summary:
      There was an off-by-one error when converting from Gregorian date to
      time_t. 

Fix:
      modified function ``dateToTimet`` in file ``webs.c``.  The ``month``
      parameter is numbered from  0 (Jan == 0), but ``FixedFromGregorian()``
      takes months numbered from 1 (January == 1). We need to add 1 to
      the month before calling FixedFromGregorian.

   

   
Bug Fixes for Version 2.1.2 
============================


Ejscript Error Messages 
------------------------

  
Summary:

      Changed ejEval() function so it displays in the browser the error string that is 
      reported by the ejScript interpreter (old code discarded it completely).

Fix:
    modified ``websuemf.c``
   

Security Handler Response Codes 
--------------------------------

  
Summary:
      Several places in the ``websSecurityHandler()`` function were
      returning error code 200 (success) instead of the correct 400-level error code.
Fix:
      Corrected error codes in ``security.c``
   
Security Handler Memory Leak 
-----------------------------

  
Summary:
      In ``websSecurityHandler()``, if the WebServer was compiled with
      ``WEBS_SSL_SUPPORT`` enabled, there was a return path that leaked
      memory.

Fix:
      Added call to ``bfree(B_L, accessLimit);``
   
Ejscript Write Corruption 
--------------------------

  
Summary:
      Very long text strings passed to the Ejscript ``write()`` function
      were being corrupted before being displayed.
      
Fix:
      Commented out a ``trace()`` statement in ``ejGetLexToken()`` that appears to have been the
      culprit. The value of ``ep->token`` was being corrupted somewhere
      in the trace.
   
Error in dsnprintf(): "%X" format 
----------------------------------

  
Summary:
      The "%X" format specifier did not correctly cause the function to output
      uppercase hexadecimal digits.

Fix:
      Added support for the "%X" format specifier.
   
BUG018565 Re-fixed 
-------------------

  
Summary:
      See 2.1.1 release notes (below). This bug fix did not make it into the
      2.1.1 release.
      
Fix:
      Corrected code in ``sockGen.c``.
   
Potential Error in ``error()`` 
-------------------------------


  
Summary:
      If ``error()`` is called where the etype parameter is not E_LOG, E_ASSERT, 
      or E_USER, the call to ``bfreeSafe(B_L, buf)`` now at line 71 will fail, 
      because 'buf' is randomly  initialized. 

Fix:
      We format a message saying that this is an unknown message type, 
      and in doing so give buf a valid value.    
    

Added Support For Customized Access Control 
--------------------------------------------

  
Summary:
      Several users requested a method to control URL access in a hierarchical
      fashion. For example, users assigned to an 'admin' group might have
      access to all URLs on the WebServer, and users assigned to the group
      'technician' would have access to a smaller set of pages, and users
      assigned to the group 'users' would perhaps only have access to a set of
      read-only pages. The built-in WebServer access control system only
      allows users to access URLs that exactly match their group membership. 
      
Fix:
      Added call to a user-supplied function `` bool_t dmfCanAccess(const
      char_t* userGroup, const char_t* group)``. This function is called
      from inside ``umUserCanAccessURL()`` if the macro
      ``qHierarchicalAccess`` is defined. 
   
   

Memory Leak in websParseRequest() 
----------------------------------

  
Summary:
      Memory was being leaked in the code now at line 907 of ``webs.c``.

Fix:
      Added a call to ``bfree()``.
   
Macintosh OS X Support  
========================


A separate Mac OS X platform directory has been added, and this platform
has been tested on version 10.1.5 of the operating system.
To build the WebServer on OS X::

   cd MACOSX
   make


Note that like all \*nix operating systems, only the root user has
permission to open a server port with a lower number than 1024. You must
run the WebServer as root to serve pages over port 80, or change the server
port (in ``main.c``) to a different port (typically port 8080).
   
   


Bug Fixes for Version 2.1.1
===========================

Intermittent Access Error for CGI Scripts (BUG01937)
----------------------------------------------------

   
Summary:
      Pages were occasionally replaced with the message, ``Access Error: Data 
      follows when trying to obtain CGI generated no output``. 
Fix:
      On multiple CPU systems, it is possible for a CGI application to exit before 
      its output is flushed to disk. The change for this release locates the code 
      that collects the output from the CGI application in a separate routine. 
      In addition to calling that routine from within the CGI application processing 
      loop, it is also called in a brief loop after the CGI application has exited. 
      This extra loop runs for only up to one second while the collected output 
      remains empty. If, after 1 second, the output remains empty, the original 
      course of action is followed (``Access Error`` is reported).
  
  
CPU Utilization Hangs at 100% on a Socket Disconnect (BUG01865)
---------------------------------------------------------------

   
Summary:
      This error occurs whenever a user terminates a request before the server 
      has had ample time to service it. This can be simulated by quickly hitting 
      the refresh button on the browser twice in a row, causing the first request 
      to be terminated. The server then enters into a tight loop that utilizes 
      all of its time.
      
Fix:
      Always close the socket prior to a disconnect.
  
  
Security Features can be Bypassed by Adding an Extra Slash in the URL (BUG01518)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   
Summary:
      By adding an extra slash in a URL, password prompting is bypassed, allowing 
      unrestricted access to secured pages. 
      
Fix:
      Remove multiple adjacent occurrences of slashes in the URL before passing 
      it to the security handler.
  
  
Call to ``websSetVar`` causes a crash (BUG01938)
------------------------------------------------


   
Summary:
      Whenever a request is not completed while being processed by websGetInput(), 
      a call to websDone is made, followed by an attempt to process the partial 
      request data.
      
Fix:
      Return immediately after closing the socket.
  
  
Remove stray semicolon in ``emfdb.c`` (BUG01820)
------------------------------------------------

  
Summary and Fix:
      A stray semicolon was removed from this file.
  
Novell Netware Support
======================

 
With the addition of Novell Netware in this 2.11 release, WebServer now supports these platforms:

    *  LINUX
    *  LynxOS
    *  Novell Netware </font>4.2, 5.1
    *  Mac OS X
    *  UNIX - SCO OpenServer 3.2V5.0.0
    *  VxWorks 5.3.1
    *  Windows 2000
    *  Windows 98
    *  Windows 95 
    *  Windows NT
    *  Windows CE
  
To make a Novell Netware target file (``webs.nlm``)::

   cd NW
   wmake webs.nlm
   load <path>; \webs.nlm
   webs


**Note:** This makefile lacks a valid default rule. In addition, an
environment variable (QMKVER) controls the amount of debug information
that is compiled and linked into the nlm file. If this variable is set
to ``P``, it produces a production version. All other settings
(or the omission of the variable) results in a debug version.  For other
platforms supported by WebServer, please refer to your WebServer 2.1
documentation for appropriate instructions.
