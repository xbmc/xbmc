</table><h2>Description</h2><p>The bopen procedure initializes the GoAhead block memory allocator. The block 
  allocator is a very efficient memory allocator that uses binary queues to store 
  blocks of memory. It does not do block coalescing, nor does it attempt to eliminate 
  fragmentation. Once released by bfree, memory is not actually freed to the operating 
  system, but is kept on the relevant binary queue for future use by the application.</p><p></p><p>The goal of the block allocator is to provide guaranteed, rapid allocation. 
  By calling bopen with the application memory requirements, memory can be defined 
  or allocated upfront and subsequent calls to <a href="balloc.htm">balloc</a> 
  are more likely to succeed. The block allocator is not perfect; you can still 
  get free memory of one class queue while memory requests for a large size cannot 
  be satisfied. However, in practice, many embedded applications tend to allocate 
  memory in a pattern and the balloc memory allocator works well in such environments. 
  The memory usage of the GoAhead WebServer has been optimized to allocate from 
  the fixed pool defined by bopen and it should be very predictable in its requirements. 
  The bstats procedure may be used to print out current memory statistics, including 
  per file usage information.</p><p></p><p>If you wish to supply a static buffer for the block allocator to use, set the 
  <em>buf </em>argument to a buffer of your choice and set <em>bufsize to </em>specify 
  the size of the buffer. You must also set <em>flags </em>to be B_USER_BUF. The 
  block allocated can also use the operating system's <em>malloc </em>call to 
  get memory if the <em>flags</em> argument is set to B_USE_MALLOC.</p><h2>Return Value</h2><p>Returns 0 on success.  Returns -1 if memory cannot be provided.</p><h2>Example</h2><pre>
if (bopen(NULL, B_DEFAULT_MEM, 0) < 0) {
	return NULL;
	}
</pre><h2>Stability Classification</h2><p>Stable.</p><h2></h2><h2></h2><h2>See Also</h2><p><a href="balloc.htm">balloc</a>, <a href="bfree.htm">bfree</a></p></td></tr></table>
