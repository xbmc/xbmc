See below some functions declarations for Visual Basic.

Frequently Asked Question:

Q: Each time I use the compress function I get the -5 error (not enough
   room in the output buffer).

A: Make sure that the length of the compressed buffer is passed by
   reference ("as any"), not by value ("as long"). Also check that
   before the call of compress this length is equal to the total size of
   the compressed buffer and not zero.

Got the answer! (I haven't had time to check this but it's what I got, and
looks correct):

He has the following routines working:
        compress
        uncompress
        gzopen
        gzwrite
        gzread
        gzclose

Declares follow: (Quoted from Carlos Rios <c_rios@sonda.cl>, in Vb4 form)
