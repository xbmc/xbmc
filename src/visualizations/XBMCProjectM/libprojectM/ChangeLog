New for version 1.1
------------------------------------------------------
* general performance improvements and improved video card compatability
* multi-threading during smooth preset switching
* pulse audio support
* Qt4 GUI implemented for playlist management and preset editing (jack / pulseaudio only)

New for versoin 1.01
------------------------------------------------------
* Bugfixes

New for version 1.00
------------------------------------------------------
This release includes months of refactoring. The code changes are immense. The list below does not even begin to explain the amount of upheaval that has occured.
	
*Smooth Preset Switching

*OpenGL Framebuffer Objects (sharper rendering)

*PerPixel Warp effect added

*Custom Shape Texturing via Images (imageURL property)

*Serious Parser/Evaluator improvements for better .milk Compatability

*projectM-engine can render to a texture instead of the framebuffer (see projectM-test/projectM-test-texture.cpp)

*projectM-engine, projectM-xmms, projectM-jack, and projectM-test build system converted to CMake

*3D Song title animation

*New Configuration File (more options, more flexible)

New for version 0.99
------------------------------------------------------
*config file now saved at ~/.projectM/config

*internal rendering coordinate spaces corrected. (basically, I made some stupid decisions a long time ago, and just fixed them now)

*xmms plugins close properly via window decorations

*mouse cursor hidden in xmms-projectM during fullscreen
	
*menus should resize relative to the screen size now
	
*Fixed numerous compilation bugs 

*when the player changes to a new song, libprojectM will zoom in the title for a few seconds, then blend the title into the vis (ala milkdrop), if the player support sending the title to libprojectM (only xmms-projectM now)
	

New for version 0.98
------------------------------------------------------
*projectM has been refactored into a shared library called libprojectM.
    -Now compiles as C++ (even though 99% of the code is C)
	
*libvisual-projectM now supports libvisual 0.4.0
	
*Preset library updated (~150 new, ~25 removed)
	
*Improved Rendering Engine
    -rewrote per pixel mathematics
    -fixed waveforms 0, 1, and 4
    -fixed Order of drawing (Vectors, Custom Shapes, Custom Waves, Waveform, Borders)
    -fixed custom shape rotation and texture parameter bugs
    -added support for the bDarkenCenter feature
    -added pbuffer support (however, you can't use it yet)
    -improved motion vectors when using pbuffers
	
*Improved .milk Parser
     -corrected behavior of frame, wave, and shape init_eqns
     -fixed bug with multiple equations on one line

*Menu/Help/Display System Improvements
    -Replaced GLF with FTGL (TrueType) fonts.
    -Added the solarize, brighten, darken, and invert filters to the post-processing menu
    -(F4) new Rendering stats display
    -(F5) Framerate display fixed
   
*New Framerate limiter
	
*n0dalus contributed some autotools patches.
	
*Chris Byrne of Monstavision contributed:
         -3 Memory Leak fixes!
         -Performance improvements during PCM input
	 -Preset index code rewritten to allow presets to be added while projectM is running 
	 
*Hai Zaar helped us clean up the autotools stuff
         -Presets/fonts will be stored in $DATADIR/projectM/fonts and /presets
         -The config file will be stored in $SYSCONFDIR/projectM
         -By default DATADIR is $PREFIX/share and SYSCONFDIR is $PREFIX/etc
             so we reccomend you run configure like so:
	          
	     ./configure --sysconfdir=/etc
