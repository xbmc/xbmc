Kodi includes a built-in [Python interpreter](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_%28programming_language%29)
that allows users to develop add-ons (scripts and plugins) that interface easily
and cleanly with the Kodi dashboard. These add-ons can extend the functionality
of Kodi without requiring extensive programming experience or ability. While you
may not feel comfortable browsing the Kodi source code and submitting patches (or
even bug reports), you can learn how to write a script or plugin with just a few
hours' practice, using the information available in these pages.

This page is intended as an introduction to Kodi Python for new developers, and
a quick reference for more experienced programmers. If you're not interested in
programming, you might want to visit [this page](http://kodi.wiki/view/Add-ons)
for information about installing and using Python add-ons as an end user. If
you're already familiar with Kodi Python, you can probably skip on down to the
[environment details](http://kodi.wiki/view/Python_Development#Environment_details)
or the [resource links](http://kodi.wiki/view/Python_Development#Resource_links)
below for quick reference material.

Built-in modules
----------------

In addition to the standard libraries, Kodi [Python](https://www.python.org/)
uses a handful of custom modules to expose Kodi functionality to Python.

| Module                              | Description                                                |
|------------------------------------:|:-----------------------------------------------------------|
| \ref python_xbmc       "xbmc"       | Offers classes and functions that provide information about the media currently playing and that allow manipulation of the media player (such as starting a new song). You can also find system information using the functions available in this library.
| \ref python_xbmcgui    "xbmcgui"    | Offers classes and functions that manipulate the Graphical User Interface through windows, dialogs, and various control widgets.
| \ref python_xbmcplugin "xbmcplugin" | Offers classes and functions that allow a developer to present information through Kodi's standard menu structure. While plugins don't have the same flexibility as scripts, they boast significantly quicker development time and a more consistent user experience.
| \ref python_xbmcaddon  "xbmcaddon"  | Offers classes and functions that manipulate the add-on settings, information and localization.
| \ref python_xbmcvfs    "xbmcvfs"    | Offers classes and functions that allow access to the Virtual File Server (VFS) which you can use to manipulate files and folders.
| \ref python_xbmcwsgi   "xbmcwsgi"   | The [<b>Web Server Gateway Interface (WSGI)</b>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Server_Gateway_Interface) is a specification for simple and universal interface between web servers and web applications or frameworks for the Python programming language.
| \ref python_xbmcdrm    "xbmcdrm"    | Offers classes and functions to create and manipulate a DRM CryptoSession .

Installing additional modules
----------------

Additional modules may be installed by simply adding the module to the root
folder of your add-on.

A common way to organized third-party modules that are not part of add-on source
code itself, is to add a lib directory and place an __init__.py file and other
third-party modules inside it. These modules may then normally be imported using
from lib import some module.

_ _ _

Python plugins versus scripts
----------------

Please do not confuse "Plugins" with "Scripts". Unlike the Scripts, Plugins are
not meant to be directly invoked by the user. Instead, Plugins are automatically
invoked when the user enters such a virtual folder. Do not try to run Plugins
files from the scripts window as that will only give you a weird error message.
Plugins, unlike Scripts, do not really provide new functionality to Kodi,
instead what they do do is provide an easy way to present content listings in
Kodi through the native GUI interface.

_ _ _

Script development
----------------

If you're new to Python programming (or just new to Kodi Python), the easiest
way to get started is with a script. The traditional Hello World program,
written as an Kodi Python script, would look like this:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.py}
print("Hello World!")
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
That's the same code you would enter at the Python command line, because Kodi
runs a full-featured, standard Python interpreter (for more information
concerning the current version number and included modules see the environment
details below). If you're already familiar with Python programming, the only new
challenge is learning the custom modules that allow you to gather information
from Kodi and manipulate the Graphical User Interface (GUI).

There are some excellent tutorials available to introduce you to Kodi scripting
(and Python in general). See the [HOW-TO](http://kodi.wiki/view/HOW-TO_write_Python_Scripts)
included in the Kodi Online Manual, or visit Alexpoet's Kodi Scripting site for
a popular beginner's tutorial (PDF).

_ _ _
Plugin development
----------------

While scripts offer you flexibility and full control over the Kodi GUI, plugins
allow you to quickly and consistently present information to the user through
the standard Kodi menu structure.

When a user launches a plugin, the plugin generates a list of menu items and
hands them to Kodi to draw on the screen (regardless of screen resolution, skin,
or any other user setting). While plugin developers lose some amount of control
over the presentation, they no longer have to make up their own UIs, or worry
about creating a usable look and feel across multiple displays.

Plugins are most commonly used to scrape websites for links to streaming videos,
displaying the video list in Kodi just like it would movie files on the local
hard drive, but a plugin can be used anywhere a script could, as long as the
menu structure is a sufficient GUI for the add-on's needs.

Also, note that a script can launch a plugin, and a plugin can launch a script
(and, for that matter, it can call all the same functions available to a script)
so the distinction is more theoretical than practical.
