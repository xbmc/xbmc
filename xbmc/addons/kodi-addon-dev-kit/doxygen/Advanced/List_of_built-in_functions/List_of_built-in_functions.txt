Skins can use built-in functions with the <onclick> or <onfocus> tag. Scripts
can call built-in functions with xbmc.executebuiltin(function, block).

The latest up-to-date list of built-in functions can be found in the source
code files in [1].

In addition to the following list, for most <onclick> and <onfocus> button
actions in the skin you can also use the functions from Keyboard.xml.

Example:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.xml}
  <onclick>VolumeUp</onclick>
  <onclick>VolumeDown</onclick>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can use parameters with all media windows, as can be seen here:
