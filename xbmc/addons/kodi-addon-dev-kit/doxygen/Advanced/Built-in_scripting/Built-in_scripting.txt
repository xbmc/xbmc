Kodi contains several built-in functions that can be accessed from the skin (via
a button), from within a python script, or [keymap](http://kodi.wiki/view/Keymap).

\section page_built_in_scripting_sect1 General form of built-in Functions

Built-in functions take the form

~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  [XBMC.]Function(param1,param2,...)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The <c>XBMC.</c> prefix is optional. Some parameters are required, depending
on the function. In parsing built-in functions, Kodi first treats quoted (using
double quotes ") character strings as literal, and drops the quotes. Thus, when
inside a quote, any otherwise special characters will be ignored until the quote
is complete. Parameters are separated by commas and, given that functions may be
parameters to other functions (such as with the AlarmClock function), anything
within brackets () are treated as a single block as well. Finally, prior to
passing parameters into the function, any initial and trailing spaces are
removed. This system allows you to pass in functions as parameters (the commas
used for the passed function are ignored as they're within a () block), as well
as allowing you to ignore whitespace around parameter separators. If you wish to
pass commas in directly as part of a parameter, simply put quotes around the
parameter string - Kodi will strip off the quotes prior to passing it in. Lastly,
to pass in an actual quote character, make sure it's escaped (using the <c>\\</c>
character), as in "\".

__Some examples:__

~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.xml}
  ActivateWindow(VideoFiles, path_to_some_files )
  ActivateWindow(VideoFiles,path_to_some_files)
  ActivateWindow(VideoFiles,"path_to_some_files")
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
will all produce the exact same functionality, under the assumption that
`path_to_some_files` contains no initial or trailing spaces (unlikely) and no
unmatched brackets and commas. The "ActivateWindow" function will be called with
two parameters: "VideoFiles" (the window to open) and "path_to_some_files" (a
starting path for the browsing). If path_to_some_files contains initial or
trailing spaces, or contains commas or brackets, then only the last form will
function correctly.

\section page_built_in_scripting_sect2 Using Built-in Functions from the skin

To have a button (or toggle button) on the skin run a particular function, you
just have to add an <onclick> tag (or <onfocus> tag) containing the function you
wish to run.
For example, adding the following to a button control will create a stop button.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.xml}
  onclick>PlayerControl(Stop)</onclick>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you want a button in your skin taking you directly to the movie listing, add
a parameter to the Window ID as follows:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.xml}
  <onclick>ActivateWindow(myvideolibrary,movietitles)</onclick>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A list of parameters can be found here:

\section page_built_in_scripting_sect3 Using Built-in Functions from python

To run a built-in Kodi function from within a python script or compiled C++ add-on,
you just need to call executebuiltin() with the function name. For example,

for Python:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.py}
 xbmc.executebuiltin('XBMC.RunScript(Q:\Scripts\myscript.py)')
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
or for C++:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.cpp}
  CAddonLib_General::ExecuteBuiltin("XBMC.RunScript(Q:\Scripts\myscript.py)");
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

will run the script myscript.py located in the Scripts directory. On 28.11.2011 a
optional parameter was added. Normal call will be non-blocking - so it returns
before the extraction has been finished. Now it's possible to call built-in
functions blocking by doing,

for Python:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.py}
  xbmc.executebuiltin('XBMC.RunScript(Q:\Scripts\myscript.py)', True)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
or for C++:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.cpp}
  CAddonLib_General::ExecuteBuiltin("XBMC.RunScript(Q:\Scripts\myscript.py)", true);
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

\section page_built_in_scripting_sect4 Using Built-in Functions from keymap.xml

To bind a built-in function to a particular key, you just add the built-in
command to the appropriate section and button in keymap.xml

For example, to map the running of an executeable to the BLACK button, we'd add:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.xml}
  <gamepad>
    ...
    <black>XBMC.RunXBE(E:\Apps\AVALaunch.xbe)</black>
    ...
  </gamepad>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

to whatever window section of keymap.xml is appropriate.
For more information on changing the keymapping with keymap.xml see: Changing the
keymapping
