NOTE:

This directory contains independent Headers to build Add-on's
without the whole XBMC source tree. The Add-on itself can add
this headers to his source tree without dependencies to any
XBMC related classes or functions.

Also this headers are never changed without a API Version
change.

The current PVR API version can be found in xbmc_pvr_types.h:
XBMC_PVR_API_VERSION
