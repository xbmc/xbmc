                                  Changelog

Version 7.21.4 (17 Feb 2011)

Guenter Knauf (17 Feb 2011)
- Set -fpcc-struct-return only for gcc compiler.

Daniel Stenberg (17 Feb 2011)
- RELEASE-NOTES: credits since 7.21.3
  
  I went through all the names mentioned as authors and in commit messages
  since 7.21.3, and this list inserted now is sorted on first name.

- nss_load_key: fix unused variable warning

- gmtime: remove define
  
  It turns out some systems rely on the gmtime or gmtime_r to be defined
  already in the system headers and thus my "precaution" redefining of
  them only caused trouble. They are now removed.

Guenter Knauf (13 Feb 2011)
- Added -m32 to CFLAGS to compile with x86_64 gcc.

- Updated OpenSSL version, added links to docu.

Daniel Stenberg (10 Feb 2011)
- RELEASE-NOTES: synced with 3bb1291fbd4

- --keepalive-time: warn if not supported properly
  
  Since the feature requires support for TCP_KEEPIDLE and TCP_KEEPINTVL to
  function as documented, it now warns if that support is missing when the
  option is used.

Dan Fandrich (10 Feb 2011)
- Call ERR_peek_error instead of ERR_peek_last_error
  
  The latter isn't available in older OpenSSL versions, and is
  less useful since it returns the most recent error instead of
  the first one encountered.

Julien Chaffraix (10 Feb 2011)
- netrc: Enable setting up the filename in unit tests.
  
  Unset the environment variable so that we can specify different
  filenames in the unit test.

- test1304: Added some unit tests for Curl_parsenetrc.
  
  Moved some definitons into the header file so that we can reuse them.

Daniel Stenberg (9 Feb 2011)
- [Quinn Slack brought this change]

  CURLE_TLSAUTH_FAILED: removed
  
  On second thought, I think CURLE_TLSAUTH_FAILED should be eliminated. It
  was only being raised when an internal error occurred while allocating
  or setting the GnuTLS SRP client credentials struct. For TLS
  authentication failures, the general CURLE_SSL_CONNECT_ERROR seems
  appropriate; its error string already includes "passwords" as a possible
  cause. Having a separate TLS auth error code might also cause people to
  think that a TLS auth failure means the wrong username or password was
  entered, when it could also be a sign of a man-in-the-middle attack.

- [Quinn Slack brought this change]

  TLS-SRP: new options documented

- CURLOPT_SOCKOPTFUNCTION: return proper error code
  
  When the callback returns an error, this function must make sure to return
  CURLE_ABORTED_BY_CALLBACK properly and not CURLE_OK as before to allow the
  callback to properly abort the operation.

- curl.1: typo in -v description

Julien Chaffraix (7 Feb 2011)
- netrc: Removed dead code.
  
  The main has not been updated from some time and is out of sync with
  the code. The code is now tested by several test cases so no need for
  a seperate code path.

- netrc: Tightened up the type checks.
  
  The state should not be anonymous so that we can check if the values
  are fine. Added 2 unreachables states to the switch as a result of this
  change.

- imap: Fixed typo in a comment.

Daniel Stenberg (7 Feb 2011)
- Curl_gmtime: avoid future mistakes
  
  Document Curl_gmtime() and define away the old functions so that they
  won't be used internally again by mistake.

- Curl_gmtime: added a portable gmtime
  
  Instead of polluting many places with #ifdefs, we create a single place
  for this function, and also check return code properly so that a NULL
  pointer returned won't cause problems.

Guenter Knauf (3 Feb 2011)
- mk-ca-bundle.vbs: use new cacert url
  
  The official Mozilla page at http://www.mozilla.org/projects/security/certs/
  points out a new place as the "proper" place to get Mozilla's CA certs from
  so this script is now updated to use that instead.

  multi: fix CURLM_STATE_TOOFAST for multi_socket

- FAQ: clarified/expanded 6.7 a bit
  
  "6.7 What are my obligations when using libcurl in my commercial apps?"
  got the piece about what exactly "in all copies" mean to a user of the
  code.
  
  This interpretation is based on what other MIT-like licenses have made
  more explicit.

  Windows build: alternative makefile
  
  This is a separate makefile for MSVC builds. It is deliberately put in
  another dir than src/ and lib/ to allow a different build experience

  unify.

- test: add test 580 to the dist

Dan Fandrich (27 Jan 2011)

Daniel Stenberg (27 Jan 2011)
- ares: memory leak fix
  
  The double name resolve trick used with c-ares could leave allocated
  memory in 'temp_ai' if the operation was aborted in the middle.

- ares_query_completed_cb: don't touch invalid data
  
  When this callback is called due to the destruction of the ares handle,
  the connection pointer passed in as an argument may no longer pointing
  to valid data and this function doesn't need to do anything with it
  anyway so we make sure it doesn't.

  ... to not make the connection between the tool and the libcurl used
  tighter than necessary, the tlsauth options are now always present but
  if the used libcurl doesn't have TLSAUTH support it will return failure.
  
  Also, replaced strncmp() with strequal to get case insensitive matching.

- symbols-in-versions: add the new TLSAUTH-SRP symbols

- configure: TLS-SRP wasn't added as a feature
  
  Test case 1014 failed since TLS-SRP was correctly set to the features
  variable so curl-config --features didn't output it.

  The idea that the protocol and socktype is part of name resolving in the
  libc functions is nuts. We keep the name resolver functions assume
  TCP/STREAM and we make sure that when we want to connect to a UDP

  the ->protocol field was not always set correctly.

  The CheckTypeSize module that comes with CMake 2.6.2 and above does

- curlcheck.h: add fail_if() fix code
  
  The UNITTEST_START and UNITTEST_STOP defines needed to do a new brace
  level so that test cases can declare variables fine and still remain
  fine C89 code.

- unittests: basic docs

- ignore: unit test files

- unittests: a dedicated feature in tests
  
  The test runner script now knows if unittests can run and the unit test
  setup file says it is one. I also made runtests.pl deal with no
  <command> tag set, so that the description file can get even simpler.

- unittesting: build a separate static lib
  
  When configure --enable-debug has been used, all files in lib/ are now
  built twice and a separate static library crafted for unit-testing will
  be linked. The unit tests in the tests/unit subdir will use that
  library.

- unittest: framework for unit-testing
  
  This is the first approach at doing fairly clean and easy to write and
  debug unit tests.

- SSH: avoid PATH_MAX with alloc
  
  We cannot assume that PATH_MAX will be enough for the remote path name
  so allocating room for it is the only sensible approach.

- TODO: get rid of PATH_MAX

- Curl_nss_connect: avoid PATH_MAX
  
  Since some systems don't have PATH_MAX and it isn't that clever to
  assume a fixed maximum path length, the code now allocates buffer space
  instead of using stack.

  Bug: http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=608521

- SFTP: make pwd output result to header callback
  
  Sending "pwd" as a QUOTE command only sent the reply to the
  DEBUGFUNCTION. Now it also sends an FTP-like header to the header
  callback to allow similar operations as with FTP, and apps can re-use
  the same parser.

- pubkey_show: allocate buffer to fit any-size result
  
  The loop condition was wrong so keys larger than 340 bits would overflow
  the local stack-based buffer.

Daniel Stenberg (27 Dec 2010)
- c-ares: fix cancelled resolves
  
  When built IPv6-enabled, we could do Curl_done() with one of the two
  resolves having returned already, so when ares_cancel() is called the
  resolve callback ends up doing funny things (sometimes resulting in a
  segfault) since it would try to actually store the previous resolve even
  though we're shutting down the resolve.
  
  This bug was introduced in commit 8ab137b2bc9630ce so it hasn't been
  included in any public release.

  Typo / spelling fixes.

- [Brad Hards brought this change]

  Use angle address, as for the rest of the example.
  
  Also spelling fix for RECIPIENT #define.

- [Brad Hards brought this change]

  Add angle brackets to addresses in easy SMTP examples, as for smtp-multi example.

- cookies: tricked dotcounter fixed
  
  Providing multiple dots in a series in the domain field (domain=..com) could
  trick the cookie engine to wrongly accept the cookie believing it to be
  fine. Since the tailmatching would then match all .com sites, the cookie would
  then be sent to all of them.
  
  The code now requires at least one letter between each dot for them to be
  counted. Edited test case 61 to verify this.

- multi: connect fail => use next IP address
  
  When using the multi interface and connecting to a host name that
  resolves to multiple IP addresses, there was no logic that made it
  continue to the next IP if connecting to the first address times
  out. This is now corrected.

- smtp-multi: put recipient within <brackets>
  
  Even if libcurl might to do it for us, it is more correct.

- ossl_seed: no more RAND_screen
  
  RAND_screen() is slow, not thread-safe and not needed anymore since OpenSSL
  uses the thread-safe win32 CryptoAPI nowadays.

- multi: inhibit some verbose outputs
  
  The info about pipe status and expire cleared are clearly debug-related
  and not anything mere mortals will or should care about so they are now
  ifdef'ed DEBUGBUILD

- SMTP tests: updated MAIL FROM use
  
  They were all wrong previously since none used the <brackets> they
  should for MAIL FROM. Now libcurl adds them itself if the app doesn't so
  they end up wrong less easy.

- CURLOPT_MAIL_FROM: document the bracket situation

- [Brad Hards brought this change]

  SMTP: add brackets for MAIL FROM
  
  Similar to what is done already for RCPT TO, the code now checks for and

  easier to implement.
  
  Note that as long as c-ares returns IPv4 addresses when IPv6 addresses

  occur twice in the DNS cache.

- axTLS: mention it among the other SSL libs

- 7.21.4: version bump

- axtls_connect: allow connect without peer verification
  
  The SSL_SERVER_VERIFY_LATER bit in the ssl_ctx_new() call allows the
  code to verify the peer certificate explicitly after the handshake and
  then the "data->set.ssl.verifypeer" option works.

- axTLS: allow "default" SSL version as well
  
  When no explicit version is selected we should try to use whatever is
  best for us, and in the axTLS case that means TLSv1.

- axtls.c: cleanup
  
  Removed trailing whitespace
  Removed several compiler warnings
  Removed odd backslashes at some line endings

- urldate: undef hideous memory defines
  
  The public axTLS header (at least as of 1.2.7) redefines the memory
  functions. We #undef those again immediately after the public header to
  limit the damage. This should be fixed in axTLS.

  Added axTLS to autotool files and glue code to misc other files.
  axtls.h maps SSL API functions, but may change.
  axtls.c is just a stub file and will definitely change.

  ossl_connect_common: detect connection re-use
  
  ossl_connect_common() now checks whether or not 'struct
  connectdata->state' is equal 'ssl_connection_complete' and if so, will
  return CURLE_OK with 'done' set to 'TRUE'. This check prevents
  ossl_connect_common() from creating a new ssl connection on an existing
  ssl session which causes openssl to fail when it tries to parse an
  encrypted TLS packet since the cipher data was effectively thrown away
  when the new ssl connection was created.

Kamil Dudka (6 Dec 2010)
- url: provide dead_connection flag in Curl_handler::disconnect
  
  It helps to prevent a hangup with some FTP servers in case idle session
  timeout has exceeded.  But it may be useful also for other protocols
  that send any quit message on disconnect.  Currently used by FTP, POP3,
  IMAP and SMTP.

- Curl_wait_for_resolv: correct timeout
  
  When looping in this function and checking for the timeout being
  expired, it was not updating the reference time when calculating the
  timediff since previous round which made it think each subsequent loop
  to have taken longer than it actually did.
  
  I also modified the function to use the generic Curl_timeleft() function
  instead of the custom logic.

- gnutls->handshake: improved timeout handling
  
  When no timeout is set, we call the socket_ready function with a timeout
  value of 0 during handshake, which makes it loop too much/fast in this
  function. It also made this function return CURLE_OPERATION_TIMEDOUT
  wrongly on a slow handshake.
  
  However, the particular bug report that highlighted this problem is not
  solved by this fix, as this fix only makes the more proper error get
  reported instead.

- version-check.pl: display version number for symbols
  
  This script is the start of a helper tool that scans a source code and
  outputs the most recent libcurl version it finds symbols for. Meaning
  that if there's no conditions in the code, that's the earliest libcurl
  version the scanned code requires.
  
  It is not added to the Makefile.am yet as it is still a bit crude, but
  I'm committing it to keep it and allow us to work on it.

- krb5: Use GSS_ERROR to check for error.
  
  This is the advised way of checking for errors in the GSS-API RFC.
  Also added some '\n' to the error message so that they are not mixed
  with other outputs.

- security: Pass the right parameter to init.
  
  init is expecting app_data. Passing it the struct connecdata would make
  us crash later.

Daniel Stenberg (11 Nov 2010)
- HTTP Auth: Add CURLAUTH_ONLY
  
  This is a meta symbol. OR this value together with a single specific
  auth value to force libcurl to probe for un-restricted auth and if not,
  only that single auth algorithm is acceptable.
  
  For example you can use CURLAUTH_DIGEST|CURLAUTH_ONLY to make libcurl
  first probe for what method to use, but yet only consider Digest to be
  acceptable.
  
  Using _only_ CURLAUTH_DIGEST without the CURLAUTH_ONLY field, will make
  libcurl explicitly use Digest right away and not do any probing.

- ip_version: moved to connection struct
  
  The IP version choice was previously only in the UserDefined struct
  within the SessionHandle, but since we sometimes alter that option
  during a request we need to have it on a per-connection basis.
  
  I also moved more "init conn" code into the allocate_conn() function
  which is designed for that purpose more or less.

- setxattr: fix the checks
  
  My copy and paste job was a little too much copy and I missed to adjust
  it properly to sys/xattr.h all over and this is a fix to cure that.

- CURLOPT_RESOLVE: added
  
  CURLOPT_RESOLVE is a new option that sends along a curl_slist with
  name:port:address sets that will populate the DNS cache with entries so
  that request can be "fooled" to use another host than what otherwise
  would've been used. Previously we've encouraged the use of Host: for
  that when dealing with HTTP, but this new feature has the added bonus
  that it allows the name from the URL to be used for TLS SNI and server
  certificate name checks as well.
  
  This is a first change. Surely more will follow to make it decent.

  LDAP: detect non-binary attributes properly

- xattr: add configure check and #ifdefs
  
  setxattr is a glibc call to set extended attributes, so configure now
  checks for it and the code is adapted to only build when the
  functionality is present.

- [Stefan Tomanek brought this change]

  save metadata to extended file attributes
  
  It is often convinient to track back the source of a once downloaded
  file; this patch makes curl store the source URL and other metadata
  alongside the retrieved file by using the extended attributes (if
  supported by the file system and enabled by --xattr).

- test: remove test 580
  
  Test 580 is removed again for two reasons:
  
  1) Some compilers aren't satisfied by just a data variable called 'test'
  when first.o wants a function called 'test'. The Solaris compiler says
  "ld: warning: symbol `test' has differing types:" while the AIX compiler
  downright rejects it.
  
  2) Test case 1119 that was added after this test is way more complete
  and cover everything test 580 does and more without introducing the same
  problems.

- curl.1: added a few missing exit codes

- certcheck: use the custom Host: name for checks
  
  If you use a custom Host: name in a request to a SSL server, libcurl
  will now use that given name when it verifies the server certificate to
  be correct rather than using the host name used in the actual URL.

- SNI: simplify the custom host name use
  
  The redirect check is already done at the position where the customhost
  field is assigned so there's no point in doing that a second time.

- host: get the custom Host: name more genericly
  
  When given a custom host name in a Host: header, we can use it for
  several different purposes other than just cookies, so we rename it and
  use it for SSL SNI etc.

  SNI: set name to custom Host header
  
  OpenSSL SNI host name should be set to the custom Host header, if the

- fopen.c: re-indented, fixed previous mistake
  
  I've made the code intended using curl-style now to look more like other
  examples.
  
  My previous "fix" was a bit too invasive but is now fixed again.

- multi use: call multi_perform even on select() timeouts

- example: add smtp-multi.c
  
  An example application source code sending SMTP mail with the multi
  interface. It is based on the code Alona Rossen provided, which in turn
  is based on existing example/test code, and I converted it even more
  into a decent example with a fair multi API use, put the info required
  to edit at the top and I added some comments.

- dist: add symbol-scan.pl to the tarball

- test1119: verify symbols-in-versions

- runtests: allow tests written as perl scripts
  
  If a command is set type="perl", it can now specify a perl program that will
  be run instead of an ordinary curl or built tool.
  
  A perl test automatically disables memory and valgrind debugging.

- symbol-scan: verifies symbols-in-versions
  
  This new script scans for all enums and #defines used by the curl/curl.h
  and curl/multi.h headers. Then it reads all symbols mentioned in
  symbols-in-vesions and make sure that there's no entries missing in
  there. It then proceeds to verify that the entries that
  symbols-in-vesions mentions but aren't found in the sources are truly
  documented as removed.
  
  This script is used in the new test case 1119

- symbols-in-versions: added 119 missing symbols
  
  I've developed a script I call symbol-scan.pl that scans the curl.h and
  multi.h header files and compare the symbols it finds in there with the
  symbols symbols-in-versions documents and outputs a report on the
  differences.  Using this I've dug through the history to fill up
  symbols-in-versions with all the symbols my script found mismatches for.
  
  I will commit symbol-scan.pl separatly and think of a way to put it to
  use in the build/tests so that we from now on will get this in-sync
  check automatically.

Dan Fandrich (2 Nov 2010)
- Added mk580.pl to the tar ball

Daniel Stenberg (2 Nov 2010)
- symbols-in-versions: added missing symbols

- ignore: lib580.c is generated by mk580.pl

- test: added test 580 - verifies symbols-in-versions
  
  The new perl script mk580.pl generates a C table in a fresh source file
  named lib580.c and if that compiles fine we know that the file
  docs/libcurl/symbols-in-versions at least doesn't include any symbols
  that are misspelled.
  
  An additional feature would be to somehow scan curl/curl.h and compare
  with symbols-in-versions to see if there are symbols missing.

Daniel Stenberg (20 Oct 2010)
- SSH: use libssh2_session_handshake()
  
  In libssh2 1.2.8, libssh2_session_handshake() replaces
  libssh2_session_startup() to fix the previous portability problem with
  the socket type that was too small for win64 and thus easily could cause
  crashes and more.

- SSH: avoid using the libssh2_ prefix
  
  It is a bad idea to use the public prefix used by another library and
  now we realize that libssh2 introduces a symbol in the upcoming version
  1.2.8 that conflicts with our static function named libssh2_free.

- formdata: provide error message
  
  When failing to build form post due to an error, the code now does a
  proper failf(). Previously libcurl would report an error like "failed
  creating formpost data" when a file wasn't possible to open which was
  not easy for users to figure out.
  
  I also lower cased a function name to be named more curl-style and
  removed some unnecessary code.

- URL-parsing: consider ? a divider
  
  The URL parser got a little stricter as it now considers a ? to be a
  host name divider so that the slightly sloppier URLs work too. The
  problem that made me do this change was the reported problem with an URL
  like: www.example.com?email=name@example.com This form of URL is not
  really a legal URL (due to the missing slash after the host name) but is
  widely accepted by all major browsers and libcurl also already accepted
  it, it was just the '@' letter that triggered the problem now.
  
  The side-effect of this change is that now libcurl no longer accepts the
  ?  letter as part of user-name or password when given in the URL, which
  it used to accept (and is tested in test 191). That letter is however
  mentioned in RFC3986 to be required to be percent encoded since it is
  used as a divider.

  introduces the same check at the second place in the code where the file
  size from the libssh2 stat call is used.
  
  This check might not be suitable for a 32 bit curl_off_t, but libssh2.h
  assumes long long to work and to be 64 bit so I believe such a small
  curl_off_t will be very unlikely to occur in the wild.

- globbing: fix crash on unballanced open brace
  
  Having an open brace without a closing brace caused a segfault.
  
  Having a closing brace too many caused a silent error to occur, which
  caused curl to bail out and return an error code but no error message
  was shown. It does now!
  
  All error message outputs no longer wrongly get _two_ newlines written
  after the error message.

  |tmp| was never set back to buf->data.
  
  Cleaned up Curl_sec_end to take into account failure in Curl_sec_login
  (where conn->mech would be NULL but not conn->app_data or
  conn->in_buffer->data).

- security.c: Remove Curl_sec_fflush_fd.
  
  The current implementation would make us send wrong data on a closed
  socket. We don't buffer our data so the method can be safely removed.

  Re-added the clear text handling in sec_recv.

- security.c: Fix Curl_sec_login after rewrite.

  This change makes configure make sure that if GnuTLS is requested and

  LDAP: Support for tunnelling queries through HTTP proxy
  
  As of curl-7.21.1 tunnelling ldap queries through HTTP Proxies is not
  supported. Actually if --proxytunnel command-line option (or equivalent
  CURLOPT_HTTPPROXYTUNNEL) is used for ldap queries like
  ldap://ldap.my.server.com/... You are unable to successfully execute the
  query. In facts ldap_*_bind is executed directly against the ldap server
  and proxy is totally ignored. This is true for both openLDAP and
  Microsoft LDAP API.
  
  Step to reproduce the error:
  Just launch "curl --proxytunnel --proxy 192.168.1.1:8080
  ldap://ldap.my.server.com/dc=... "
  
  This fix adds an invocation to Curl_proxyCONNECT against the provided
  proxy address and on successful "CONNECT" it tunnels ldap query to the
  final ldap server through the HTTP proxy. As far as I know Microsoft
  LDAP APIs don't permit tunnelling in any way so the patch provided is
  for OpenLDAP only.  The patch has been developed against OpenLDAP 2.4.23
  and has been tested with Microsoft ISA Server 2006 and works properly
  with basic, digest and NTLM authentication.

- timeout: use the correct start value as offset
  
  Rodric provide an awesome recipe that proved libcurl didn't timeout at
  the requested time - it instead often timed out at [connect time] +
  [timeout time] instead of the documented and intended [timeout time]
  only. This bug was due to the code using the wrong base offset when
  comparing against "now". I could also take the oppurtinity to simplify
  the code by properly using of the generic help function for this:
  Curl_timeleft.
  
  Reported by: Rodric Glaser
  Bug: http://curl.haxx.se/bug/view.cgi?id=3061535

- Curl_timeleft: avoid returning "no timeout" by mistake
  
  As this function uses return code 0 to mean that there is no timeout, it
  needs to check that it doesn't return a time left value that is exactly
  zero. It could lead to libcurl doing an extra 1000 ms select() call and
  thus not timing out as accurately as it should.
  
  I fell over this bug when working on the bug 3061535 but this fix does
  not correct that problem alone, although this is a problem that needs to

- multi: fixes for timing out handles
  
  Add a timeout check for handles in the state machine so that they will
  timeout in all states disregarding what actions that may or may not
  happen.
  
  Fixed a bug in socket_action introduced recently when looping over timed
  out handles: it wouldn't assign the 'data' variable and thus it wouldn't
  properly take care of handles.
  
  In the update_timer function, the code now checks if the timeout has
  been removed and then it tells the application. Previously it would
  always let the remaining timeout(s) just linger to expire later on.

- threaded resolver: no more expire 0 calls
  
  Curl_expire() set to 0 expires ALL timeouts so it should only be called
  if we truly and really want to remove all timeouts for the handle.

- resolve_server: simplify code
  
  Make use of the helper function Curl_timeleft() instead of duplicating
  code.

- multi: make sure the next timeout is used when one expires
  
  Each easy handle has a list of timeouts, so as soon as the main timeout
  for a handle expires, we must make sure to get the next entry from the
  list and re-add the handle to the splay tree.
  
  This was attempted previously but was done poorly in my commit
  232ad6549a68450.

  As the VC and RISCOS makefiles don't use the .inc file

- runtests: fix uninitialized variable warning

- gopher tests: revert parts of gopher in the pingpong server
  
  Introduced in the initial gopher commits, there was added logic to do
  GOPHER test serving in the pingpong server but as it resembles HTTP much
  more than FTP or SMTP, the gopher testing has been moved over to instead
  use the sws (HTTP) server. This change simply removes unused code.

- gopher tests: use sws and adjusted to more standard style

- sws: added basic gopher support

- gopher: enable the header callback/verbosity

- gopher: fix test case line endings
  
  Patches over email very easily lose CRLF line endings in files otherwise
  LF-only so I had to put them back where needed.

- gopher: fix memory leak and busyloop
  
  The fix for the busyloop really only is a temporary work-around.  It
  causes a BLOCKING behavior which is a NO-NO. This function should rather
  be split up in a do and a doing piece where the pieces that aren't
  possible to send now will be sent in the doing function repeatedly until
  the entire request is sent.

- http: handle trailer headers in all chunked responses
  
  HTTP allows that a server sends trailing headers after all the chunks
  have been sent WITHOUT signalling their presence in the first response
  headers. The "Trailer:" header is only a SHOULD there and as we need to
  handle the situation even without that header I made libcurl ignore
  Trailer: completely.
  
  Test case 1116 was added to verify this and to make sure we handle more
  than one trailer header properly.

- cmdline: make -F type= accept ;charset=
  
  The -F option allows some custom parameters within the given string, and
  those strings are separated with semicolons. You can for example specify
  "name=daniel;type=text/plain" to set content-type for the
  field. However, the use of semicolons like that made it not work fine if
  you specified one within the content-type, like for:
  "name=daniel;type=text/plain;charset=UTF-8"
  ... as the second one would be seen as a separator and "charset" is no
  parameter curl knows anything about so it was just silently discarded.
  
  The new logic now checks if the semicolon and following keyword looks
  like a parameter it knows about and if it isn't it is assumed to be
  meant to be used within the content-type string itself.
  
  I modified test case 186 to verify that this works as intended.

- Added mk-ca-bundle.vbs script.
  
  The script works exactly same as the Perl one except for one thing:
  when the text descriptions generated with openssl are included then
  the md5 fingerprints are missing; seems openssl has either a bug or
  a feature which prints the md5 fingerprint output to stdout instead
  of writing them to specified file; this script could here do the same
  as what the Perl scripr does (redirect stdout into file) but this
  makes the script take up double the time because it needs to launch
  cmd.exe 140 times (fo each openssl call). So I think for now we just
  ommit the md5 fingerprints, and see if openssl will be fixed.

  the final chunk is sent (which is "0\r\n\r\n").

- multi: avoid sending multiple complete messages

Daniel Stenberg (15 Aug 2010)
- THANKS: added contributors from 7.21.1

- multi: two fixes done

- multi: use timeouts properly for MAX_RECV/SEND_SPEED
  
  When detecting that the send or recv speed, the multi interface changes
  state to TOOFAST and previously there was no timeout set that would
  force a recheck but it would rely on the application to somehow call
  libcurl anyway. This now sets a timeout for a suitable future time to
  check again if the average transfer speed is then below the threshold
  again.

- multi: support timeouts
  
  Curl_expire() is now expanded to hold a list of timeouts for each easy
  handle. Only the closest in time will be the one used as the primary
  timeout for the handle and will be used for the splay tree (which sorts
  and lists all handles within the multi handle).
  
  When the main timeout has triggered/expired, the next timeout in time
  that is kept in the list will be moved to the main timeout position and
  used as the key to splay with. This way, all timeouts that are set with
  Curl_expire() internally will end up as a proper timeout. Previously any
  Curl_expire() that set a _later_ timeout than what was already set was
  just silently ignored and thus missed.
  
  Setting Curl_expire() with timeout 0 (zero) will cancel all previously
  added timeouts.
  
  Corrects known bug #62.

- Curl_llist_insert_next: allow insertion first in the list
  
  When we specify the "insert after" entry as NULL, this function now
  inserts the new entry first in the list.

- multi: make curl_multi_info_read perform O(1)
  
  Instead of looping over all attached easy handles, this now keeps a list
  of messages in the multi handle. It allows curl_multi_info_read() to
  perform O(1) no matter how many easy handles that are handled. This is
  of importance since this function may be polled very frequently by apps
  using the multi interface.

- RELEASE-NOTES: mention the runtests fix as well

- runtests: clear old setenv remainders before test
  
  Due to the layout of the singletest function there are situations where
  it returns before it clears the environment variables that were
  especially set for the single specific test case. That could lead to
  subsequent tests getting executed with environment variables sticking
  around from a previous test which could lead to badness.
  
  This change makes sure to clear all custom variables that may be laying
  around from a previous round, before running a test case.

  when handles are added. This is now mentioned in the "TYPICAL USAGE"
  section.

- callbacks: acknowledge progress callback error returns
  
  When the progress callback is called during the TCP connection, an error
  return would accidentally not abort the operation as intended but would
  instead be counted as a failure to connect to that particular IP and
  libcurl would just continue to try the next. I made singleipconnect()
  and trynextip() return CURLcode properly.
  
  Added bonus: it corrected the error code for bad --interface usages,
  like tested in test 1084 and test 1085.

- More Watcom makefile fixes ...
  
  Final fix (hopefully!) for dll wlink loader;
  prefer faster internal rm if available.

- Fixed my wrong edit.

- More Watcom makefile fixes.
  
  Added the -br switch to dynamic builds which fixes the issue I saw
  with curl's --version output. Added debug info and symfile for debug
  builds to linker opts. Added DLL loader for wlink back, but this time
  dependend on wlink version.
  Patch posted to the list by malak.jiri AT gmail.com.

- Changed test for -u switch in order to enable other wmake switches.
  
  The var %MAKEFLAGS is only set in 3 cases: if set as environment
  var or as macro definition from commandline, and either with the
  -u or -ms switch. Since all these cases are unlikely for the average
  user it should be safe to only test if %MAKEFLAGS is defined; this
  has the benefit that now all other switches can be used again in
  addition to the -u which was formerly not possible.

- parse_remote_port: fix ;type= URL suffix over HTTP proxy
  
  Test 563 is enabled now and verifies that the combo FTP type=A URL,
  CURLOPT_PORT set and proxy work fine. As a bonus I managed to remove the
  somewhat odd FTP check in parse_remote_port() and instead converted it
  to a better and more generic 'slash_removed' struct field. Checking the
  ->protocol field isn't right since when an FTP:// URL is sent over a
  HTTP proxy, the protocol is HTTP but the URL was handled by the FTP code
  and thus slash_removed is set TRUE for this case.

- warning: silence a win64 compiler warning
  
  conversion from 'size_t' to 'curl_socklen_t', possible loss of data
  
  Reported by: Adam Light

- KNOWN_BUG: The SOCKET type in Win64 is 64 bits
  
  The SOCKET type in Win64 is 64 bits large (and thus so is curl_socket_t
  on that platform), and long is only 32 bits. It makes it impossible for
  curl_easy_getinfo() to return a socket properly with the
  CURLINFO_LASTSOCKET option as for all other operating systems.

- smtp_connect: always provide host name buffer
  
  Previously the host name buffer was only used if gethostname() exists,
  but since we converted that into a curl private function that function
  always exists and will be used so the buffer needs to exist for all
  cases/systems.

- sethostname: avoid including unistd.h to duck for warnings

- sethostname: ISO C does not allow extra `;' outside of a function

- [Kamil Dudka brought this change]

  NTLM tests: boost coverage by forcing the hostname
  
  A shared library tests/libtest/.libs/lihostname.so is preloaded in NTLM
  test-cases to override the system implementation of gethostname().  It
  makes it possible to test the NTLM authentication for exact match, and
  this way test the implementation of MD4 and DES.
  
  If LD_PRELOAD doesn't work, a debug build willl also workk as debug
  builds are now made to prefer a specific environment variable and will
  then return that content as host name instead of the actual one.
  
  Kamil wrote the bulk of this, Daniel Stenberg polished it.

    it seems they're not needed (anymore?).
  - added rule for hugehelp.c.cvs so that it will be created when not

    since there we have no hugehelp.c.cvs, thus compilation broke.
  - removed C_ARG creation from lib/Makefile.Watcom and use CFLAGS

  ftp: response timeout bug in "quote" sending
  
  The FTP implementation was missing a timestamp reset point, making the
  waiting for responses after sending a post-transfer "QUOTE" command not
  working as supposedly. This bug was introduced in 7.20.0

- [Jeff Pohlmeyer brought this change]

  remote-header-name: chop filename at next semicolon
  
  The --remote-header-name option for the command-line tool assumes that
  everything beyond the filename= field is part of the filename, but that
  might not always be the case, for example:
  
  Content-Disposition: attachment; filename=file.txt; modification-date=...
  
  This fix chops the filename off at the next semicolon, if there is one.

- --retry: access violation with URL part sets continued
  
  When getting multiple URLs, curl didn't properly reset the byte counter
  after a successful transfer so if the subsequent transfer failed it
  would wrongly use the previous byte counter and behave badly (segfault)
  because of that. The code assumes that the byte counter and the 'stream'
  pointer is well in synch.

  multi: fix condition that remove timers before trigger
  
  curl_multi perform has two phases: run through every easy handle calling
  multi_runsingle and remove expired timers (timer removal).
  
  If a small timer (e.g. 1-10ms) is set during multi_runsingle, then it's
  possible that the timer has passed by when the timer removal runs. The
  timer which was just added is then removed. This will potentially cause
  the timer list to be empty and cause the next call to curl_multi_timeout
  to return -1. Ideally, curl_multi_timeout should return 0 in this case.
  
  One way to fix this is to move the struct timeval now = Curl_tvnow(); to
  the top of curl_multi_perform. The change does that.

  upload: Avoid infinite loop when checking for auth bits
  
  The test would loop forever if authtype bit 0 wasn't set.

- upload: warn users trying to upload from stdin with anyauth
  
  Since uploading from stdin is very likely to not work with anyauth and
  its multi-phase probing for what authentication to actually use, alert
  the user about it. Multi-phase negotiate almost certainly will involve
  sending data and thus libcurl will need to rewind the stream to send
  again, and it cannot do that with stdin.

- http: don't enable chunked during authentication negotiations
  
  As mentioned in bug report #2956968, the HTTP code wouldn't send the
  first empty chunk during the auth negotiation phase of the HTTP request
  sending, so the server would wait for data to come and libcurl would
  wait for data to arrive... I've made the code not enable chunked
  encoding until the auth negotiation is done and thus this scenario
  doesn't occur anymore.

- --libcurl: list the tricky options instead of using [REMARK]
  
  I think the [REMARK] and commented function calls cluttered the code a
  bit too much and made the generated code ugly to read. Now we instead
  track the remarks one specially and just lists them at the end of the
  generated code more as additional information.

- curl: avoid setting libcurl options to its default
  
  it makes the --libcurl output easier to follow.

- --libcurl: hide setopt() calls setting default options
  
  And additionally, don't show function or object pointers actual value
  since they make no sense to anyone. Show 'functionpointer' and
  'objectpointer' instead.

- --libcurl: use *_LARGE options with typecasted constants
  
  In the generated code --libcurl makes, all calls to curl_easy_setopt()
  that use *_LARGE options now have the value typecasted to curl_off_t, so
  that it works correctly for 32bit systems with 64bit curl_off_t type.

- multi: CURLINFO_LASTSOCKET doesn't work after remove_handle
  
  When curl_multi_remove_handle() is called and an easy handle is returned
  to the connection cache held in the multi handle, then we cannot allow
  CURLINFO_LASTSOCKET to extract it since that will more or less encourage
  that the user uses the socket while it can get used by libcurl again.
  
  Without this fix, we'd get a segfault in Curl_getconnectinfo() trying to
  dereference the NULL pointer in 'data->state.connc'.

Kamil Dudka (30 Jun 2010)
- http_ntlm: add support for NSS
  
  When configured with '--without-ssl --with-nss', NTLM authentication
  now uses NSS crypto library for MD5 and DES.  For MD4 we have a local
  implementation in that case.  More details are available at
  https://bugzilla.redhat.com/603783
  
  In order to get it working, curl_global_init() must be called with
  CURL_GLOBAL_SSL or CURL_GLOBAL_ALL.  That's necessary because NSS needs
  to be initialized globally and we do so only when the NSS library is
  actually required by protocol.  The mentioned call of curl_global_init()
  is responsible for creating of the initialization mutex.
  
  There was also slightly changed the NSS initialization scenario, in
  particular, loading of the NSS PEM module.  It used to be loaded always
  right after the NSS library was initialized.  Now the library is
  initialized as soon as any SSL or NTLM is required, while the PEM module
  is prevented from being loaded until the SSL is actually required.

  examples: new FTP wildcard showcase

- multi_socket: re-use of same socket without notifying app
  
  When a hostname resolves to multiple IP addresses and the first one
  tried doesn't work, the socket for the second attempt may get dropped on
  the floor, causing the request to eventually time out. The issue is that
  when using kqueue (as on mac and bsd platforms) instead of select, the
  kernel removes the first fd from kqueue when it is closed (in trynextip,
  connect.c:503). Trynextip() then goes on to open a new socket, which
  gets assigned the same number as the one it just closed. Later in
  multi.c, socket_cb is not called because the fd is already in
  multi->sockhash, so the new socket is never added to kqueue.
  
  The correct fix is to ensure that socket_cb is called to remove the fd
  when trynextip() closes the socket, and again to re-add it after
  singleipsocket(). I'm not sure how to cleanly do that, but the attached
  patch works around the problem in an admittedly kludgy way by delaying
  the close to ensure that the newly-opened socket gets a different fd.
  
  Daniel's added comment: I didn't spot a way to easily do a nicer fix so
  I've proceeded with Ben's patch.

  OpenSSL: fix spurious SSL connection aborts
  
  Was seeing spurious SSL connection aborts using libcurl and
  OpenSSL. I tracked it down to uncleared error state on the
  OpenSSL error stack - patch attached deals with that.
  
  Rough idea of problem:
  
  Code that uses libcurl calls some library that uses OpenSSL but
  don't clear the OpenSSL error stack after an error.
  
  ssluse.c calls SSL_read which eventually gets an EWOULDBLOCK from
  the OS. Returns -1 to indicate an error
  
  ssluse.c calls SSL_get_error. First thing, SSL_get_error calls
  ERR_get_error to check the OpenSSL error stack, finds an old
  error and returns SSL_ERROR_SSL instead of SSL_ERROR_WANT_READ or
  SSL_ERROR_WANT_WRITE.
  
  ssluse.c returns an error and aborts the connection
  
  Solution:
  
  Clear the openssl error stack before calling SSL_* operation if
  we're going to call SSL_get_error afterwards.
  
  Notes:
  
  This is much more likely to happen with multi because it's easier
  to intersperse other calls to the OpenSSL library in the same
  thread.

- multi_socket: handles timer inaccuracy better for timeouts
  
  Igor Novoseltsev reported a problem with the multi socket API and
  using timeouts and timers. It boiled down to a problem with
  libcurl's use of GetTickCount() interally to figure out the
  current time, while Igor's own application code used another
  function call.
  
  It made his app call the socket API timeout function a bit
  _before_ libcurl would consider the timeout to trigger, and that
  could easily lead to timeouts or stalls in the app. It seems
  GetTickCount() in general often has no better resolution than
  16ms and switching to the alternative function
  QueryPerformanceCounter has its share of problems:
  http://www.virtualdub.org/blog/pivot/entry.php?id=106
  
  We address this problem by simply having libcurl treat timers
  that already has occured or will occur within 40ms subject for
  treatment. I'm confident that there are other implementations and
  operating systems with similarly in accurate timer functions so
  it makes sense to have applied generically and I don't believe we
  sacrifice much by adding a 40ms inaccuracy on these timeouts.

  wouldn't make any difference in behavior. I decided to still keep
  it (but fix the problem) as it now actually allows for easier
  (future) customization of the timeout.

- OpenSSL: multi interface handshake could hang
  
  John-Mark Bell filed bug #3000052 that identified a problem (with
  an associated patch) with the OpenSSL handshake state machine
  when the multi interface is used:
  
  Performing an https request using a curl multi handle and using
  select or epoll to wait for events results in a hang. It appears
  that the cause is the fix for bug #2958179, which makes
  ossl_connect_common unconditionally return from the step 2 loop
  when fetching from a multi handle.
  
  When ossl_connect_step2 has completed, it updates
  connssl->connecting_state to ssl_connect_3. ossl_connect_common
  will then return to the caller, as a multi handle is in
  use. Eventually, the client code will call curl_multi_fdset to
  obtain an updated fdset to select or epoll on. For https
  requests, curl_multi_fdset will cause https_getsock to be called.
  https_getsock will only return a socket handle if the
  connecting_state is ssl_connect_2_reading or
  ssl_connect_2_writing.  Therefore, the client will never obtain a
  valid fdset, and thus not drive the multi handle, resulting in a
  hang.

  it didn't properly ignore the response body of the 30X response
  if that response was using compressed Content-Encoding!

  Remove support for BSD version of PolarSSL
  
  "The BSD version of PolarSSL was made for migratory purposes only and is not
  maintained. The GPL version of PolarSSL is actually the only actively
  developed version, so I would be very reluctant to use the BSD version." /

- Added Polar SSL and RTMP files to the non-autoconf build files

  sendrecv: make them two pairs of send/recv to properly deal with FTPS
  
  FTP(S) use two connections that can be set to different recv and
  send functions independently, so by introducing recv+send pairs
  in the same manner we already have sockets/connections we can
  work with FTPS fine.
  
  This commit fixes the FTPS regression introduced in change d64bd82.

- git: how to write a fine commit message

- findtool: file name as a full path requires a slash
  
  Kalle Vahlman's patch applied a while ago broke how the findtool
  function searches for tools, as it would always check if "$file"
  was present first, which thus made the bad assumption that a file
  in the current directory would be a match.
  
  I noticed when it found 'libtool' in the current directory but
  libtoolize is not there, which confused the script.

Hacki (8 May 2010)
- moved vars into conditional since seems that winsock implementation doesnt use them.

Daniel Stenberg (7 May 2010)
- multi interface: missed storing connection time
  
  Dirk Manske reported a regression. When connecting with the multi
  interface, there were situations where libcurl wouldn't store
  connect time correctly as it used to (and is documented to) do.
  
  Using his fine sample program we could repeat it, and I wrote up
  test case 573 using that code. The problem does not easily show
  itself using the local test suite though.
  
  The fix, also as suggested by Dirk, is a bit on the ugly side as
  it adds yet another call to Curl_verboseconnect() and setting the
  TIMER_CONNECT time.  That situation is subject for some closer
  inspection in the future.

- verboseconnect: so the verbose checking within the function
  
  As the function is used more than once and libcurl can be built
  without it, do the conditional check within the verboseconnect()
  function itself.

- changelogs: split the I/O handling

- [Howard Chu brought this change]

  sendrecv: split the I/O handling into private handler
  
  Howard Chu brought the bulk work of this patch that properly
  moves out the sending and recving of data to the parts of the
  code that are properly responsible for the various ways of doing
  so.
  
  Daniel Stenberg assisted with polishing a few bits and fixed some
  minor flaws in the original patch.
  
  Another upside of this patch is that we now abuse CURLcodes less
  with the "magic" -1 return codes and instead use CURLE_AGAIN more
  consistently.

  PolarSSL: initial support added
  
  This is Hoi-Ho Chan's patch with some minor fixes by me. There
  are some potential issues in this, but none worse than we can
  sort out on the list and over time.

- TODO: we've done PRET already, consider HOST for the future

  integrated as a "real" protocol and RTSP is supported.

- TODO: GnuTLS connects are now non-blocking
  
  Since commit c288860 by Jerome Vouillon

- INTERNALS: tftp is decent now, ldap is not
  
  It's not quite fair to list TFTP is a "crappy" member of the
  libcurl family so I removed its mentioning.

- changelog: mention Ben Greear's telnet work

- [Ben Greear brought this change]

  telnet: Allow programatic use of telnet.
  
  The main change is to allow input from user-specified methods,
  when they are specified with CURLOPT_READFUNCTION.
  All calls to fflush(stdout) in telnet.c were removed, which makes
  using 'curl telnet://foo.com' painful since prompts and other data
  are not always returned to the user promptly.  Use
  'curl --no-buffer telnet://foo.com' instead.  In general,
  the user should have their CURLOPT_WRITEFUNCTION do a fflush
  for interactive use.
  
  Also fix assumption that reading from stdin never returns < 0.
  Old code could crash in that case.
  
  Call progress functions in telnet main loop.

- changelog: GnuTLS fix, no reverse loopkups and fixed GSS detection

- SSL_RECV: EOF is not an error here
  
  The recent overhaul of the SSL recv function made this treat a
  zero returned from gnutls_record_recv() as an error, and this
  caused our HTTPS test cases to fail. We leave it to upper layer
  code to detect if an EOF is a problem or not.

- [Paul Howarth brought this change]

  configure: GSSAPI detection on ancient Linux distros
  
  On some ancient distributions such as RHEL-3, <gssapi/gssapi_krb5.h> needs
  to be processed after <gssapi/gssapi.h>, but does not include it itself.
  This patch checks for <gssapi/gssapi.h> first and then includes it
  in the test for <gssapi/gssapi_krb5.h>, resolving the problem.
  
  Without the patch, <gssapi/gssapi_krb5.h> is "present but cannot be
  compiled".

- resolvers: no more using AI_CANONNAME
  
  No resolver anymore needs to use AI_CANONNAME and do reverse
  lookups.  We should work hard to avoid having code that relies on
  it.

- KRB5: use given host name instead of reverse lookup'ed name
  
  This code would previously use dns_entry->addr->ai_canonname
  instead of the given host name, which caused us grief and
  problems since not all our resolver options do the reverse lookup
  and I would also guess that it caused problems with KRB5/GSS with
  virtual name-based hosts. Now the host name from the URL is used.

- Curl_ipv4_resolve_r: only set AI_CANONNAME when needed
  
  As reported in bug report #2987196, the code for ipv6 already did

  code we know that might need the cannonical name so only resolve
  it for such requests!

  The section that describes how to work with timeouts was

- update URL and cut out wrong info on ipv6
  
  c-ares has had its own URL for a while and we should point
  people to that. It also works with IPv6 since a long time.

- refer to CURLMOPT_TIMERFUNCTION for multi_socket users
  
  curl_multi_timeout(3) is simply the wrong function to use
  if you're using the multi_socket API and this document now
  states this pretty clearly to help guiding users.

- s/CVS/git

- modified to use the git file, not cvs
  
  I've done this blindly, and the last piece that works with ares
  should possibly be done differently now that c-ares isn't a
  subtree within the curl tree anymore...

- mention missing test servers for <server>

- FTP quote commands prefixed with '*' now can fail without aborting
  
  Prefixing the FTP quote commands with an asterisk really only

  pop3: Get message listing if no mailbox in URL
  
  If you pass a URL to pop3 that does not contain a message ID as
  part of the URL, it will currently ask for 'INBOX' which just
  causes the pop3 server to return an error.
  
  The change makes libcurl treat en empty message ID as a request
  for LIST (list of pop3 message IDs).  User's code could then
  parse this and download individual messages as desired.

  Avoid double newline for the 'last commits' log in testcurl.pl
  
  The backtick command which extracts 'git log' lines come with a
  newline, so chomp the newline before calling logit(), as the logit
  function adds a newline by itself.

- [Tor Arntsen brought this change]

  Change to version-independent git option for 'git log --oneline'
  
  'git log --oneline' is a relatively recent Git function. It is

- [Bob Richmond brought this change]

  fix: timeout after last data chunk was handled
  
  Bob Richmond: There's an annoying situation where libcurl will
  read new HTTP response data from a socket, then check if it's a
  timeout if one is set. If the last packet received constitutes
  the end of the response body, libcurl still treats it as a
  timeout condition and reports a message like:
  
  "Operation timed out after 3000 milliseconds with 876 out of 876
  bytes received"
  
  It should only a timeout if the timer lapsed and we DIDN'T
  receive the end of the response body yet.

- avoid compiler warning without USE_ALARM_TIMEOUT

Bill Hoffman (24 Mar 2010)

  This commit fixes the cmake build of curl, and cleans up the

- chunked-encoding with Content-Length: header problem
  
  Akos Pasztory filed debian bug report #572276
  http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=572276
  mentioning a problem with a resource that returns chunked-encoded
  _and_ with a Content-Length and libcurl failed to properly ignore
  the latter information.

- delayed easy handle kill caused double Curl_close() call
  
  Hauke Duden provided an example program that made the multi
  interface crash.  His example simply used the multi interface and
  did first one FTP transfer and after completion it used a second
  easy handle and did another FTP transfer on the same FTP server.
  
  This triggered a bug in the "delayed easy handle kill" system
  that curl uses: when an FTP connection is left alive it must keep
  an easy handle around internally - only for the purpose of having
  an easy handle when it later disconnects it. The code assumed
  that when the easy handle was removed and an internal reference
  was made, that version could be killed later on when a new easy
  handle came using the same connection. This was wrong as Hauke's
  example showed that the removed handle wasn't killed for real
  until later. This caused a double close attempt => segfault.

- ignore more files generated when tests run in the source tree

- Thomas Lopatic fixed the alarm()-based DNS timeout

- [Thomas Lopatic brought this change]

  fix the alarm()-based DNS timeout
  
  Looking at the code of Curl_resolv_timeout() in hostip.c, I think
  that in case of a timeout, the signal handler for SIGALRM never
  gets removed. I think that in my case it gets executed at some
  point later on when execution has long left Curl_resolv_timeout()
  or even the cURL library.
  
  The code that is jumped to with siglongjmp() simply sets the
  error message to "name lookup timed out" and then returns with
  CURLRESOLV_ERROR. I guess that instead of simply returning
  without cleaning up, the code should have a goto that jumps to
  the spot right after the call to Curl_resolv().

    (http://curl.haxx.se/bug/view.cgi?id=2905220) was only partially fixed.
    Partially because an easy handle can be associated with many connections in
    the cache (e.g. if there is a redirect during the lifetime of the easy
    handle).  The previous patch only cleaned up the first one. The new fix now
    removes the easy handle from all connections, not just the first one.

  with threaded resolver enabled (Windows default configuration) that would
  get triggered when a curl handle is closed while doing DNS resolution.

- Added SIZEOF_INT and SIZEOF_SHORT definitions for VMS configuration file

Daniel Stenberg (4 Mar 2010)
- Julien Chaffraix clarified CURLOPT_HEADERFUNCTION and made
  CURLOPT_HEADERFUNCTION and CURLOPT_WRITEFUNCTION more consistent

- - [Daniel Johnson] I've been trying to build libcurl with clang on Darwin and
    ran into some issues with the GSSAPI tests in configure.ac. The tests first
    try to determine the include dirs and libs and set CPPFLAGS and LIBS
    accordingly. It then checks for the headers and finally sets LIBS a second
    time, causing the libs to be included twice. The first setting of LIBS seems
    redundant and should be left out, since the first part is otherwise just
    about finding headers.
  
    My second issue is that 'krb5-config --libs gssapi' on Darwin is less than
    useless and returns junk that, while it happens to work with gcc, causes
    clang to choke. For example, --libs returns $CFLAGS along with the libs,
    which is really retarded. Simply setting 'LIBS="$LIBS -lgssapi_krb5
    -lresolv"' on Darwin is sufficient.

- - Based on patch provided by Jacob Moshenko, the transfer logic now properly
    makes sure that when using sub-second timeouts, there's no final bad 1000ms
    wait. Previously, a sub-second timeout would often make the elapsed time end
    up the time rounded up to the nearest second (e.g. 1s for 200ms timeout)

- update the generic copyright year range to include 2010

- - Andrei Benea filed bug report #2956698 and pointed out that the
    CURLOPT_CERTINFO feature leaked memory due to a missing OpenSSL function
    call. He provided the patch to fix it too.
  
    http://curl.haxx.se/bug/view.cgi?id=2956698

- - Markus Duft pointed out in bug #2961796 that even though Interix has a
    poll() function it doesn't quite work the way we want it so we must disable
    it, and he also provided a patch for it.
  
    http://curl.haxx.se/bug/view.cgi?id=2961796

- - Made the pingpong timeout code properly deal with the response timeout AND
    the global timeout if set. Also, as was reported in the bug report #2956437
    by Ryan Chan, the time stamp to use as basis for the per command timeout was
    not set properly in the DONE phase for FTP (and not for SMTP) so I fixed
    that just now. This was a regression compared to 7.19.7 due to the
    conversion of FTP code over to the generic pingpong concepts.
  
    http://curl.haxx.se/bug/view.cgi?id=2956437

- remove assignment never used

- - Ben Greear provided an update for TFTP that fixes upload.

- SSL, not SSH, SSL

- - Wesley Miaw reported bug #2958179 which identified a case of looping during
    OpenSSL based SSL handshaking even though the multi interface was used and
    there was no good reason for it.

- Fixed bug report #2958074 indicating
  (http://curl.haxx.se/bug/view.cgi?id=2958074) that curl on Windows with
  option --trace-time did not use local time when timestamping trace lines.
  This could also happen on other systems depending on time souurce.

- _ Adjusted RFC821 HELO fallback and enabled test804

- - Proper handling of STARTTLS on SMTP, taking CURLUSESSL_TRY into account.
  - SMTP falls back to RFC821 HELO when EHLO fails (and SSL is not required).
  - Use of true local host name (i.e.: via gethostname()) when available, as default argument to SMTP HELO/EHLO.
  - Test case 804 for HELO fallback.

Yang Tse (22 Feb 2010)
- add header inclusion

- fix compiler warning

- fix compiler warning

Daniel Stenberg (21 Feb 2010)
- clarify more details on section "2.1 More non-blocking"

- TFTP transfers are not blocking since 7.20.0

- - Fixed the SMTP compliance by making sure RCPT TO addresses are specified
    properly in angle brackets. Recipients provided with CURLOPT_MAIL_RCPT now
    get angle bracket wrapping automatically by libcurl unless the recipient
    starts with an angle bracket as then the app is assumed to deal with that
    properly on its own.

- - I made the SMTP code expect a 250 response back from the server after the
    full DATA has been sent, and I modified the test SMTP server to also send
    that response. As usual, the DONE operation that is made after a completed
    transfer is still not doable in a non-blocking way so this waiting for 250
    is unfortunately made blockingly.

- corected a comment and wrapped a few longish lines

  moved gethostbyname_thread() to #else case to avoid 'not used' compiler warning.

- replaced tabs by spaces, removed trailing tabs/spaces.

Daniel Stenberg (13 Feb 2010)
- - Tom Donovan fixed the CURL_FORMAT_* defines when building with cmake.

- - Jack Zhang reported a problem with SMTP: we wrongly used multiple addresses
    in the same RCPT TO line, when they should be sent in separate single
    commands. I updated test case 802 to verify this.
  
  - I also fixed a bad use of my_setopt_str() of CURLOPT_MAIL_RCPT in the curl
    tool which made it try to output it as string for the --libcurl feature
    which could lead to crashes.

- CURLOPT_MAIL_RCPT is *not* a string so we must not try to printf() it

- free --mail-from strings properly

Patrick Monnerat (11 Feb 2010)
- _ Make it compilable again on OS400.
  _ Upgrade OS400 EBCDIC wrappers for new options.
  _ Upgrade ILE/RPG bindings to current state.
