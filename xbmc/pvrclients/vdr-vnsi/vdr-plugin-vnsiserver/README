CHANNEL SCANNING

For channel scan's a modified version of the wirbelscan plugin (Version dev-0.0.5-pre11e) is
required. You can download the orginal source from here "http://wirbel.htpc-forum.de/wirbelscan/index2.html".

The VNSI communicate with wirbelscan over VDR's plugin service interface, to add this feature
you must patch wirbelscan with the file in "patches/vdr-wirbelscan-0.0.5-pre11e-AddServiceInterface.diff".

Scanning can take up to 50 minutes dependet on signal type and signal quality.
    * DVB-T ~ 5 min
    * DVB-C ~ 30 min (Symbolrate=AUTO, QAM=AUTO)
    * DVB-S/S2 ~ 50 min (depend on Satellite, Beam, Hardware)
    * Analog ~ 5 min

Note: Please notice the warning on the wirbelscan plugin homepage:
      "Development Version - kein Support. Benutzung auf eigene Verantwortung."
      "Development Version - no support. Use at your own risk."
      This means, the time how long the scan run and problems on VDR side are dependet on wirbelscan
      and not part of VNSI.
