/*!
 * \class CApplicationMessenger ApplicationMessenger.h "messaging/ApplicationMessenger.h"
 * \brief This implements a simple message dispatcher/router for Kodi
 *
 * For most users that wants to send message go to the documentation for these
 * \sa CApplicationMessenger::SendMsg
 * \sa CApplicationMessenger::PostMsg
 *
 * For anyone wanting to implement a message receiver, go to the documentation for
 * \sa IMessageTarget
 *
 * IMPLEMENTATION SPECIFIC NOTES - DOCUMENTED HERE FOR THE SOLE PURPOSE OF IMPLEMENTERS OF THIS CLASS
 * On a high level this implements two methods for dispatching messages, SendMsg and PostMsg.
 * These are roughly modeled on the implementation of SendMessage and PostMessage in Windows.
 *
 * PostMsg is the preferred method to use as it's non-blocking and does not wait for any response before
 * returning to the caller. Messages will be stored in a queue and processed in order.
 *
 * SendMsg is a blocking version and has a bit more subtleties to it regarding how inter-process
 * dispatching is handled.
 *
 * Calling SendMsg with a message type that doesn't require marshalling will bypass the message queue
 * and call the receiver directly
 *
 * Calling SendMsg with a message type that require marshalling to a specific thread when not on that thread
 * will add a message to the queue with a an event, it will then block the calling thread waiting on this event
 * to be signaled.
 * The message will be processed by the correct thread in it's message pump and the event will be signaled, unblocking
 * the calling thread
 *
 * Calling SendMsg with a message type that require marshalling to a specific thread when already on that thread
 * will behave as scenario one, it will bypass the queue and call the receiver directly.
 *
 * Currently there is a hack implemented in the message dispatcher that releases the graphicslock before dispatching
 * a message. This was here before the redesign and removing it will require careful inspection of every call site.
 * TODO: add logging if the graphicslock is held during message dispatch
 *
 * Current design has three different message types
 * 1. Normal messages that can be processed on any thread
 * 2. GUI messages that require marshalling to the UI thread
 * 3. A thread message that will spin up a background thread and wait a specified amount of time before posting the message
 *    This should probably be removed, it's left for compatibility
 *
 * Heavy emphasis on current design, the idea is that we can easily add more message types to route messages
 * to more threads or other scenarios.
 *
 * \sa CApplicationMessenger::ProcessMessages()
 * handles regular messages that require no marshalling, this can be called from any thread to drive the message
 * pump
 *
 * \sa CApplicationMessenger::ProcessWindowMessages()
 * handles GUI messages and currently should only be called on the UI thread
 *
 * If/When this is expanded upon ProcessMessage() and ProcessWindowMessages() should be combined into a single method
 * taking an enum or similar to indicate which message it's interested in.
 *
 * The above methods are backed by two messages queues, one for each type of message. If more types are added
 * this might need to be redesigned to simplify the lookup of the correct message queue but currently they're implemented
 * as two member variables
 *
 * The design is meant to be very encapsulated and easy to extend without altering the public interface.
 * e.g. If GUI messages should be handled on another thread, call \sa CApplicationMessenger::ProcessWindowMessage() on that
 * thread and nothing else has to change. The callers have no knowledge of how this is implemented.
 *
 * The design is also meant to be very dependency free to work as a bridge between lower layer functionality without
 * having to have knowledge of the GUI or having a dependency on the GUI in any way. This is not the reality currently as
 * this depends on \sa CApplication and the graphicslock but should be fixed soon enough.
 *
 * To keep things simple the current implementation routes messages based on a mask that the receiver provides.
 * Any message fitting that mask will be routed to that specific receiver.
 * This will likely need to change if many different receivers are added but it should be possible to do it without
 * any of the callers being changed.
