<h2>Version 1.10.0 - 2004/11/02</h2>

<ul>
<li>Virtual machine 
<ul>
<li>Optimized the C++ VM
<li>Jumps no longer suspend the VM
<li>New byte code BC_END, only used by exception handler.
<li>Added a new module as_context_x86.cpp with an optimized VM using assembly. Compile with the flag USE_ASM_VM to utilize this new VM. (contribution by Andres "Lioric" Carrera) NOTE: This is currently slightly slower than the C++ VM, but will be optimized further in future releases.
<li>Removed the NOP instructions as they are no longer needed for alignment
<li>Added the SUSPEND bytecode again. It's used to guarantee that the host application always can suspend a context, i.e. all loops have a SUSPEND instruction.
</ul>

<li>Bug fixes
<ul>
<li>Exception handler would continue the execution 
<li>Temporary variables were not always freed after compiling a function call
<li>Constants were not always successfully converted to reference when making function calls (thanks Anthony "Deyja" Casteel)
<li>The switch case didn't treat 8 and 16 bit integer types correctly (thanks Alain "abrken" Bridel)
<li>The exception handler failed when objects where returned by reference
<li>There was a memory leak when adding script sections but not actually building them (thanks Alain "abrken" Bridel)
</ul>

<li>Script language
<ul>
<li>Added the operator 'xor' for boolean types. Alias '^^' (suggestion by Thomas Suter)
<li>Added native support for arrays
</ul>

<li>Library interface
<ul>
<li>Changed the parameter type for callConv to asDWORD in the interface
<li>If the configuration is wrong the engine writes the message "Invalid configuration" to the outstream if available. People keep forgetting to verify the return code, this may help them understand why the build isn't done.
<li>RegisterObjectBehaviour() should only be used for object behaviours. Global behaviours should be registered with RegisterGlobalBehaviour().
<li>GetFunctionName(), GetFunctionDeclaration(), GetGlobalVarName(), GetGlobalVarDeclaration(), GetImportedFunctionDeclaration(), and GetExceptionString() have changed to return a pointer to the string, so it is no longer necessary to pass a buffer to them.
<li>GetImportedFunctionSourceModule() and GetModuleNameFromIndex() now return the length as well.
<li>New global function asThreadCleanup() (see multithreading)

<li>Fixed ExecuteStep() to work as before
<ul>
<li>By default ExecuteStep() is guaranteed to suspend execution at least once per loop
<li>Added the compile flag BUILD_WITH_LINE_CUES, which makes the script compiler add extra bytecodes that allow ExecuteStep() to return after each statement.
</ul>

<li>Improved ExecuteString()
<ul>
<li>Calls to ExecuteString() can now be nested. 
<li>ExecuteString() now takes an extra parameter, which allow the application to receive the context pointer directly, or even pass its own context by using the flag asEXECSTRING_USE_MY_CONTEXT.
<li>GetContextForExecuteString() is deprecated.
<li>ExecuteString() now reports build errors with line and column number starting with the passed string.
</ul>

<li>Overridable array objects
<ul>
<li>It is now possible to register array objects, overriding the native array object
<li>New error code: asLOWER_ARRAY_DIMENSION_NOT_REGISTERED
<li>The library now returns asAPP_CANT_INTERFACE_DEFAULT_ARRAY if the application tries to register a function that uses arrays that haven't been registered by the application.
</ul>
</ul>

<li>Multithreading
<ul>
<li>Added support for multithreading (can be disabled by defining NO_THREADS)
<li>Multithreading should now work with both MSVC and MinGW. Still only for Windows though.
<li>asGetActiveContext() is now thread safe
<li>Reference counting is thread safe
<li>The engine now deletes all unused modules when Discard() is called, this simplifies the context's interaction with the modules making the engine more stable for multithreading
<li>Created the global function asThreadCleanup() that will allow AngelScript to cleanup some thread local data. Should be called before exiting any extra threads that access AngelScript.
</ul>

<li>Miscellaneous
<ul>
<li>Added the module as_thread.cpp that abstract the OS's thread functions 
<li>New module as_arrayobject.cpp for the default array implementation
<li>Added as_debug.h
<li>Made minor code changes to make compilation on Linux smoother (thanks Johannes Plass)
<li>Changed MSVC projects to output to a different file when in debugmode (thanks Dan "Aggrav8d" Royer)
<li>Added std::vector binding code to the library download (thanks Anthony "Deyja" Casteel)
<li>as_compiler_expression.cpp was merged with as_compiler.cpp
</ul>

</ul>

<ul>
<li>Bug fixes
<ul>
<li>Subtraction was optimized as if it was associative (thanks Lennart Denninger)
<li>SetArguments() failed for script functions that returns registered object types by value. (thanks Thomas Suter)
<li>The application would crash if an exception was raised in ExecuteString() (thanks Joe "Desdemona" Wright)
<li>GetFunctionName() and GetFunctionDeclaration() now works for the ExecuteString() function id as well.
<li>The compiler didn't warn when passing uninitialized variables to function parameters (thanks Alain "abrken" Bridel)
<li>Constructors with parameters could cause assertion failure in GenerateExceptionHandler(). (thanks Alain "abrken" Bridel)
</ul>
</ul>
