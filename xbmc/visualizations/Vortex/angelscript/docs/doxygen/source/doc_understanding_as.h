\page doc_understanding_as Understanding AngelScript

In order to successfully use AngelScript it is important to 
understand some differences between AngelScript and C++. While
the library has been written so that it can be embedded within
the application with as little change to the application functions
and classes as possible, there are some care that must be taken
when passing objects between AngelScript and C++.
