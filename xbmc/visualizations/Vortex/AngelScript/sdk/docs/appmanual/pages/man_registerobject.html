<h1>Registering a C++ class</h1>

<p>Before registering a class with AngelScript you need to decide how the script 
engine should interact with it. Basically there are two questions that needs 
to be answered:</p>

<ul>
<li>Should local objects be allowed to be constructed in the script?
<li>Should the script be able to take handles to the objects?
</ul>

<p>If you answered no on the first question, then you'll want to register the
object with a size of 0. This is useful if you wish to register an object type
for interacting with singletons, or you wish to have special control over how
the objects are created.</p>

<p>If you answered yes to the second question, then you'll need to register the
addref and release behaviours for the object type. These will be used to control
how many references are held by the script.</p>

<p>If you answered no to both questions then the script can only interact with the
object if it is registered as a global property, or if a registered function or method
returns a reference to the object.</p>

<p>If you answered yes to the first question, then you need to define the size of 
the object type, and perhaps even register the constructor and destructor behaviours
for initializing and cleaning up the objects.
</p>

<p>It is also possible to override how the memory is allocated for an object type,
but this will not be described in this article. This can be useful if the object type
is allocated from for example a memory pool, or if it is allocated from a DLL which
uses another memory heap than the main application.</p>

<h2>The object type</h2>

<p>The first method that must be called is RegisterObjectType(), which will
give the name for which the class will be identified with in the scripts.</p>

<pre class=border>
int RegisterObjectType(const char *name, 
                       int         byteSize, 
                       asDWORD     flags);
</pre>

<p>The name can be either a new identifier naming the new type, or it can be 
the name of an already existing datatype followed by [] (array brackets), e.g.
"MyClass" or "int[]". The second case means that the application wants to 
override the default array implementation for that specific type.</p>

<p>The second parameter is as the name suggests the size of the class in 
bytes, so normally you would use the sizeof() operator to determine this 
value. It is however valid to register an object type with the size of 0, 
which then means that the scripts may not declare local objects of that type. 
The scripts can still hold handles to the object type, or use application 
registered global objects of that type.</p>

<p>The third flag is perhaps the most important one, if this flag isn't 
correctly set it is quite possible that you will find yourself searching for 
bugs that corrupt the stack frame, or other horrible bugs. This flag tells
AngelScript about the C++ properties of the object type, i.e. how C++ is 
handling the objects in situations like returns, etc.</p>

<p>There are three main types:</p>

<table border=0 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0>
<tr><td width=150 valign=top>asOBJ_CLASS</td><td>The object type is a C++ class, structure, or union.</td></tr>
<tr><td width=150 valign=top>asOBJ_PRIMITIVE</td><td>The object type is a C++ primitive, such as int,
void *, MyClass *. The only primitives that aren't included by this flag is
float and double.</td></tr>
<tr><td width=150 valign=top>asOBJ_FLOAT</td><td>The object type is in reality a float or a double.</td></tr>
</table>

<p>For the asOBJ_CLASS flag there is also three important modifiers that should be combined with | (binary or):</p>

<table border=0 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0>
<tr><td width=200 valign=top>asOBJ_CLASS_CONSTRUCTOR</td><td>The class has a defined constructor.</td></tr>
<tr><td width=200 valign=top>asOBJ_CLASS_DESTRUCTOR</td><td>The class has a defined destructor.</td></tr>
<tr><td width=200 valign=top>asOBJ_CLASS_ASSIGNMENT</td><td>The class has an overloaded assignment operator.</td></tr>
</table>

<p>For the modifiers there is also a shorter form, example: asOBJ_CLASS_CDA. You can find these shorter forms in angelscript.h.</p>

<p>It is extremely important that this flag is set correctly as it is the only 
way AngelScript has to know how the C++ application handles the objects, for
example if the object is returned in memory, in the general registers, or in
the floating point registers.</p>

<h2>Basic behaviour</h2>

<p>After the object type has been registered, AngelScript needs to know how
an object should be moved around in memory. The important behaviours are the
way an object is constructed, destroyed, and copied from one location to 
another.</p>

<p>If no constructor is registered then AngelScript will not do anything to
initialize new objects of the registered type. This is fine for structures
and unions that don't make any presumtion on the value of the members. But 
for a class that needs to allocate resources at construction it could be big
problem. If the class declares virtual functions it is also important to 
register the constructor as the virtual function table must be initialized for 
the class at allocation.</p>

<p>If no destructor is registered then AngelScript again does nothing when
the object is destroyed, e.g. when a variable of the type goes out of scope. 
If the object allocates resources that must be freed upon destruction then it
is necessary to register the destructor. The exception is if the addref/release
behaviours are registered, since the library will then expect the application
to destroy the object in the release method, thus it never calls the destructor.</p>

<p>If no copy behaviour, or assignment behaviour as it is also called, is 
registered, then AngelScript simply copies the memory byte for byte. If the 
class needs special behaviour when being copied, for example if a new resource
must be allocated for the target object, then it is again necessary to 
register the assignment behaviour.</p>

<p>All object behaviours are registered with the following method:</p>

<pre class=border>
int RegisterObjectBehaviour(const char *datatype, 
                            asDWORD     behaviour, 
                            const char *declaration, 
                            asUPtr      funcPointer,
                            asDWORD     callConv);
</pre>

<p>The first parameter, datatype, should be the same string that was used in
RegisterObjectType(), e.g: "MyClass", or "int[]".</p>

<p>behaviour should be one of the available behaviour constants declared in
angelscript.h (see the reference manual). The most important behaviours are 
the following:</p> 

<table border=0 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0>
<tr><td width=200 valign=top>asBEHAVE_CONSTRUCT</td><td>The constructor behaviour.</td></tr>
<tr><td width=200 valign=top>asBEHAVE_DESTRUCT</td><td>The destructor behaviour.</td></tr>
<tr><td width=200 valign=top>asBEHAVE_ASSIGNMENT</td><td>The assignment or copy behaviour.</td></tr>
<tr><td width=200 valign=top>asBEHAVE_ADDREF</td><td>The addref behaviour.</td></tr>
<tr><td width=200 valign=top>asBEHAVE_RELEASE</td><td>The release behaviour.</td></tr>
</table>

<p>The declaration parameter, is used to show the parameter types and return 
type for the behaviour functions. The constructor and destructor should have 
the return type void, and no parameters. It is actually possible to register
constructors that take parameters, but the default constructor must be 
registered without any parameters. The assignment should return a reference to
the datatype in question and take a reference to the datatype, preferably a 
constant reference. It is also possible to register assignment behaviours that
take other types in the parameter, but the default behaviour must use a 
reference to it's own type.</p>

<p>Suggested declaration strings:</p>

<table border=0 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0>
<tr><td width=200 valign=top>asBEHAVE_CONSTRUCT</td><td>"void f()"</td></tr>
<tr><td width=200 valign=top>asBEHAVE_DESTRUCT</td><td>"void f()"</td></tr>
<tr><td width=200 valign=top>asBEHAVE_ASSIGNMENT</td><td>"obj &amp;f(obj &amp;in)"</td></tr>
<tr><td width=200 valign=top>asBEHAVE_ADDREF</td><td>"void f()"</td></tr>
<tr><td width=200 valign=top>asBEHAVE_RELEASE</td><td>"void f()"</td></tr>
</table>

<p>The function name used in the declaration doesn't really matter as it will 
not be stored by the engine. For the assignment the return value should be a reference to the actual object. The parameter type can be any type that AngelScript understand. If it is a reference to an object of the same type as the actual object, then the operator will also be used when copying the object in the VM, e.g. when passing the object by value to a function.</p>

<p>The fourth parameter is the actual function pointer. It is possible to 
register class methods directly or global C++ functions that take an extra 
parameter for the object pointer. It is not possible to register a class' 
constructor and destructor directly as C++ doesn't allow taking the pointer
to these methods. For these two it is therefor necessary to write a couple of
wrapper functions. My suggestion is to do it like this:</p>

<pre class=border>
void Constructor(MyClass *obj)
{
  new(obj) MyClass();
}

void Destructor(MyClass *obj)
{
  obj->~MyClass();
}
</pre>

<p>The placement new operator, new(void*), is declared in new.h in the 
standard C++ library.</p>

<p>To get the function pointer to the function or method you wish to register
you should use the following macros:</p>

<table border=0 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0>
<tr><td width=200 valign=top>asFUNCTION(function)</td><td>Get the function pointer of a global function.</td></tr>
<tr><td width=200 valign=top>asFUNCTIONPR(function, p, r)</td><td>Get the function pointer of an overloaded function. p is the parameter list and r is the return type.</td></tr>
<tr><td width=200 valign=top>asMETHOD(class, method)</td><td>Get the method pointer of a class method.</td></tr>
<tr><td width=200 valign=top>asMETHODPR(class, method, p, r)</td><td>Get the method pointer of an overloaded class method.</td></tr>
</table>

<p>Make sure you don't use a virtual method for the constructor behaviour as 
one of it's task is to initialize the virtual function table pointer. 
AngelScript doesn't support class methods for classes with virtual 
inheritance. If you need to use such a class you will have to write wrapper 
functions for the methods you wish to register. Classes with multiple 
inheritance is supported though.</p>

<p>The final parameter to RegisterObjectBehaviour() tells AngelScript what 
calling convention that the function is using. For registered object 
behaviours the supported calling conventions are:</p>

<table border=0 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0>
<tr><td width=200 valign=top>asCALL_THISCALL</td><td>Class method with fixed number of parameters.</td></tr>
<tr><td width=200 valign=top>asCALL_CDECL_OBJLAST</td><td>Global cdecl function that takes the pointer to the object as the last parameter, after all declared parameters.</td></tr>
<tr><td width=200 valign=top>asCALL_CDECL_OBJFIRST</td><td>Global cdecl function that takes the object pointer as the first parameter before any declared parameter.</td></tr>
<tr><td width=200 valign=top>asCALL_GENERIC</td><td>Global function implementing the generic calling convention.</td></tr>
</table>

<p>The other object behaviours found in the reference manual are registered
in a similar manner as described above.</p>

<h2>Object properties and methods</h2>

<p>Now that AngelScript knows how to properly handle the registered object 
type you can continue to add the interface that the script writer will have
to access the object's internals such as it's properties and methods.</p>

<pre class=border>
int RegisterObjectProperty(const char *obj, 
                           const char *declaration, 
                           int         byteOffset);
</pre>

<p>The first parameter is again the name of the object type.</p>

<p>The seond parameter is the declaration of the property, with its datatype
and name, e.g. "int value". If you want to make the property read-only simply
declare it with the const modifier.</p>

<p>The third parameter is the byteoffset of the property in the class 
structure. Normally you would determine this offset by using the macro 
offsetof(class, property) that is declared in stddef.h.</p>

<pre class=border>
int RegisterObjectMethod(const char *obj, 
                         const char *declaration, 
                         asUPtr      funcPointer, 
                         asDWORD     callConv)
</pre>

<p>This method is used to register object methods that can be called from the
script. The parameters are pretty much the same as for 
RegisterObjectBehaviour(), except that there is no behaviour flag, and the 
function name used in the declaration is used by the scripts to call the 
method.</p>

<h2>Operator behaviours</h2>

<p>Sometimes it can be useful to allow the scripts to manipulate objects 
through operators, i.e. using + to concatenate two strings. These overloaded 
operator behaviours are registered with either RegisterObjectBehaviour() or
RegisterGlobalBehaviour(). Binary operators are generally registered with
RegisterGlobalBehaviour(), whereas unary operator are registered with 
RegisterObjectBehaviour(). The exception is the assignment operators that are
binary but are registered with RegisterObjectBehaviour().</p>

<pre class=border>
int RegisterGlobalBehaviour(asDWORD     behaviour, 
                            const char *declaration, 
                            asUPtr      funcPointer, 
                            asDWORD     callConv)
</pre>

<p>The first parameter is the behaviour flag, as found in the reference 
manual.</p>

<p>The second is the function signature, where just as for 
RegisterObjectBehaviour() the function name doesn't matter. Observe that it is
not possible to override the operators for the built-in primitives in 
AngelScript, at least one of the parameters must be a registered object type.
</p>

<p>The function pointer is obtained with the same macros as earlier.</p>

<p>The last parameter has a different set of calling conventions available 
though, as we are now registering a global function.</p>

<table border=0 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0>
<tr><td width=200 valign=top>asCALL_CDECL</td><td>Global cdecl function, that can have variable number of parameters.</td></tr>
<tr><td width=200 valign=top>asCALL_STDCALL</td><td>Global stdcall function with fixed number of parameters.</td></tr>
<tr><td width=200 valign=top>asCALL_GENERIC</td><td>Global function using the generic calling convention.</td></tr>
</table>

<p>Although it is possible to register a global function that takes a variable 
number of parameters, AngelScript will always send a fixed number of arguments 
as it doesn't support variable number of arguments in functions.</p>
