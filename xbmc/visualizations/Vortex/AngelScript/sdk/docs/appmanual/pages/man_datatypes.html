<h1>Datatypes in AngelScript and C++</h1>


<h2>Primitives</h2>

<p>Primitives in AngelScript have direct matches in C++.</p>

<p>There is currently no 64 bit integer available in AngelScript.</p>

<h2>Arrays</h2>

<p>The AngelScript arrays are not directly matched by C++ arrays. The arrays
are stored in an special object. Thus you can normally not directly exchange
a script with a C++ function expecting a C++ array, or vice versa. Nor can
the application register C++ arrays as properties and expect AngelScript to
be able to understand them.</p>

<p>It is however possible to override AngelScript's built-in array objects
with application specified objects, on a per array type basis.</p>

<h2>Object handles</h2>

<p>The AngelScript object handles are reference counted pointers to objects.
This means that for object handles to work, the object must have some way of
counting references, for example an AddRef/Release method pair.</p>

<p>When AngelScript passes an object handle by value to a function it 
increases the reference count to count for the argument instance, thus the 
function is responsible for releasing the reference once it is finished with 
it. In the same manner AngelScript expects any handle returned from a function 
to already have the reference accounted for.</p>

<p>However, when registering functions/methods with AngelScript the 
application can tell the library that it should automatically take care of 
releasing the handle references once a function return, likewise for returned 
handles. This is done by adding a + sign to the @ type modifier. When doing 
this an object handle can be safely passed to a C++ function that expects a 
normal pointer, but don't release it afterwards.</p>

<h2>Parameter references</h2>

<p>Because AngelScript needs to guarantee validity of pointers at all times,
it doesn't always pass references to the true object to the function 
parameter. Instead it creates a copy of the object, whose reference is passed 
to the function, and if the reference is marked to return a value, the clone 
is copied back to the original object (if it still exists) once the function 
returns.</p>

<p>Because of this, AngelScript's parameter references are mostly compatible
with C++ references, or pointers, except that the address normally shouldn't be
stored for later use, since the object may be destroyed once the function returns.</p>

<p>If it is necessary to store the address of the object, then object handles
should be used instead.</p>

<table cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0>
<tr><td width=100><b>Reference</b></td><td><b>Description</b></td></tr>

<tr><td valign=top>&amp;in</td><td>A copy of the value is always taken and the reference to the copy is passed to the function. For script functions this is not useful, but it is maintained for compatibility with application registered functions.</td></tr>

<tr><td valign=top>const &amp;in</td><td>If the life time of the value can be guaranteed to be valid during the execution of the function, the reference to the true object is passed to the function, otherwise a copy is made.</td></tr>

<tr><td valign=top>&amp;out</td><td>A reference to an unitialized value is passed to the function. When the function returns the value is copied to the true reference. The argument expression is evaluated only after the function call. This is the best way to have functions return multiple values.</td></tr>

<tr><td valign=top>const &amp;out</td><td>Useless as the function wouldn't be able to modify the value.</td></tr>

<tr><td valign=top>&amp;inout</td><td>The true reference is always passed to the function. If the life time of the value cannot be guaranteed, a compile time error is generated and the script writer will have to copy the value to a local variable first. Objects that support object handles are best suitable for this type as they can always be guaranteed.</td></tr>

<tr><td valign=top>const &amp;inout</td><td>The reference cannot be changed by the function.</td></tr>
</table>

<p>If the application wants parameter references that work like they do in C++, then the script library can be compiled with the flag AS_ALLOW_UNSAFE_REFERENCES defined. When this is done, the parameter references can be declared without the <code>in</code>, <code>out</code>, or <code>inout</code>. The parameter references declared without any of the keywords will always pass the address to the original value, and will not have any restrictions to the expressions that can be used. The parameter references with the <code>in</code> and <code>out</code> keywords will still work like before, but the refernces with the <code>inout</code> keyword will have the restrictions removed so that they work just like normal C++ references.</p>

<p>The application writer and script writer has to be aware that it is possible to write scripts that access invalid references when the library is compiled in this mode, just like it is possible to do so in C++.</p>
