2008-08-30 01:42  danf

	* CHANGES, tests/data/DISABLED, tests/data/Makefile.am,
	  tests/data/test1069, tests/data/test1071, tests/data/test1072,
	  tests/data/test1073, tests/data/test1074, tests/data/test1075:
	  Added tests 1071 through 1074 to test automatic downgrading from
	  HTTP 1.1 to HTTP 1.0 upon receiving a response from the HTTP
	  server.  Tests 1072 and 1073 are similar to test 1069 in that
	  they involve the impossible scenario of sending chunked data to a
	  HTTP 1.0 server.  All these currently fail and are added to
	  DISABLED.

	  Added test 1075 to test --anyauth with Basic authentication.

2008-08-29 12:48  bagder

	* tests/data/Makefile.am: test 1070 added

2008-08-29 12:47  bagder

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES, TODO-RELEASE, lib/transfer.c,
	  tests/FILEFORMAT, tests/data/test1070, tests/server/sws.c: - When
	  libcurl was doing a HTTP POST and the server would respond with
	  "Connection: close" and actually close the connection after the
	  response-body, libcurl could still have outstanding data to send
	  and it   would not properly notice this and stop sending. This
	  caused weirdness and	 sad faces.
	  http://curl.haxx.se/bug/view.cgi?id=2080222

	    Note that there are still reasons to consider libcurl's
	  behavior when
	    getting a >= 400 response code while sending data, as Craig
	  Perras' note
	    "http upload: how to stop on error" specifies:

	* acinclude.m4, include/curl/curlbuild.h.dist,
	  include/curl/curlbuild.h.in, include/curl/curlrules.h,
	  lib/Makefile.netware: For congruency sake with the naming of

	  recommended setting, this prevents the undesired inclusion of
	  header files with the same name as those of OpenSSL but which do
	  not belong to the OpenSSL package. The visible change from
	  previously released libcurl versions is that now OpenSSl enabled
	  NetWare builds also define USE_OPENSSL in config files, and that
	  OpenSSL header files must be located in a subdirectory named
	  'openssl'.

	  As it is documented, when trying to build on non-configure
	  capable systems or on systems which for any reason don't run the
	  true configure script, it is required to have the proper
	  curlbuild.h in place before calling any makefile.

	  Due to the hardcore memory debugging stuff c-ares enabled debug
	  builds also need the file in the proper place before attempting
	  to build c-ares.

	* ares/: CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES, ares_init.c: - Fix by Tofu Linden:

	    The symptom:
	    * Users (usually, but not always) on 2-Wire routers and the
	  Comcast service
	    and a wired connection to their router would find that the
	  second and
	    subsequent DNS lookups from fresh processes using c-ares to
	  resolve the same
	    address would cause the process to never see a reply (it keeps
	  polling for
	    around 1m15s before giving up).

	    The repro:
	    * On such a machine (and yeah, it took us a lot of QA to find
	  the systems
	    that reproduce such a specific problem!), do 'ahost
	  www.secondlife.com',
	    then do it again.  The first process's lookup will work,
	  subsequent lookups
	    will time-out and fail.

	    The cause:
	    * init_id_key() was calling randomize_key() *before* it
	  initialized
	    key->state, meaning that the randomness generated by
	  randomize_key() is
	    immediately overwritten with deterministic values.
	  (/dev/urandom was also
	    being read incorrectly in the c-ares version we were using, but
	  this was
	    fixed in a later version.)
	    * This makes the stream of generated query-IDs from any new
	  c-ares process
	    be an identical and predictable sequence of IDs.
	    * This makes the 2-Wire's default built-in DNS server detect
	  these queries
	    as probable-duplicates and (erroneously) not respond at all.

	  ares/acinclude.m4, ares/configure.ac: Autoconf 2.62 has changed
	  the behaviour of the AC_AIX macro which we use.  Prior versions
	  of autoconf defined _ALL_SOURCE if _AIX was defined. But,
	  autoconf 2.62 version of AC_AIX defines _ALL_SOURCE along with
	  other four preprocessor symbols no matter if the system is AIX or

	  one, across autoconf versions AC_AIX is replaced with our own

	  libcurl always sets the size of the _entire_ upload if an app

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES, lib/transfer.c: - David Bau filed bug
	  report #2026240 "CURL_READFUNC_PAUSE leads to buffer	 overrun"
	  (http://curl.haxx.se/bug/view.cgi?id=2026240) identifying two
	  problems, and providing the fix for them:

	    - CURL_READFUNC_PAUSE did in fact not pause the _sending_ of
	  data that it is
	      designed for but paused _receiving_ of data!

	    - libcurl didn't internally set the read counter to zero when
	  this return
	      code was detected, which would potentially lead to junk
	  getting sent to
	      the server.

2008-07-26 02:19  yangtse

	* tests/testcurl.pl: No longer hide aclocal 'underquoted

	  http://sources.redhat.com/automake/automake.html#Extending-aclocal
	  documents that starting with Automake 1.8, aclocal will warn
	  about all underquoted calls to AC_DEFUN due to the fact that in a
	  single aclocal run it might include more than once all .m4 files
	  which it finds available, this includes .m4 files from other
	  software packages.

	  If the first argument to AC_DEFUN is underquoted and the same
	  macro is included more than once, successive inclusions after the
	  first one will expand the macro instead of assuming it is the
	  same as the first one included.

	  NOTE: the name resolve functions of various libc implementations

2008-07-03 13:32  bagder

	* ares/: CHANGES, ares_gethostbyname.c: - Phil Blundell: If you ask
	  ares_gethostbyname() to do an AF_INET6 lookup and   the target
	  host has only A records, it automatically falls back to an
	  AF_INET lookup and gives you the A results.  However, if the
	  target host has   a CNAME record, this behaviour is defeated
	  since the original query does   return some data even though
	  ares_parse_aaa_reply() doesn't consider it   relevant. Here's a
	  small patch to make it behave the same with and without   the
	  CNAME.

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES, lib/http.c, lib/transfer.c,
	  tests/data/Makefile.am, tests/data/test1033: Phil Blundell

	  Introcuding a new timestamp for curl_easy_getinfo():
	  CURLINFO_APPCONNECT_TIME. This is set with the "application
	  layer" handshake/connection is completed (typically SSL, TLS or
	  SSH). By using this you can figure out the application layer's
	  own connect time. You can extract the time stamp using curl's -w
	  option and the new variable named 'time_appconnect'. This feature
	  was sponsored by Lenny Rachitsky at NeuStar.

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES, acinclude.m4, ares/CHANGES,
	  ares/RELEASE-NOTES, ares/acinclude.m4, ares/ares__timeval.c,

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES, docs/INSTALL, include/curl/curl.h: -
	  Rolland Dudemaine provided fixes to get libcurl to build for the
	  INTEGRITY   operating system.

2008-07-01 23:53  bagder

	* lib/url.c: CreateConnection collided with a function using the
	  exact same name in the INTEGRITY RTOS, so I renamed it to
	  create_conn. It then made sense to also rename SetupConnection to
	  setup_conn to match it.

2008-07-01 12:29  yangtse

	* configure.ac, ares/configure.ac: IBM C/C++ compiler predefined

	* acinclude.m4, ares/acinclude.m4: make check message wording more
	  precise

	  output the range using a signed variable where it should rather
	  use	unsigned.

2008-06-30 14:58  bagder

	* lib/mprintf.c: made %llu work for printing unsigned long longs,
	  added the generic curl source header

2008-06-30 14:48  bagder

	* ares/: CHANGES, ares_init.c, nameser.h: - As was pointed out to
	  me by Andreas Schuldei, the MAXHOSTNAMELEN define is	 not posix
	  or anything and thus c-ares failed to build on hurd (and possibly
	    elsewhere). The define was also somewhat artificially used in
	  the windows	port. Now, I instead rewrote the use of
	  gethostbyname to enlarge the host   name buffer in case of need
	  and totally avoid the use of the MAXHOSTNAMELEN   define. I thus
	  also removed the defien from the namser.h file where it was
	  once added for the windows build.

	    I also fixed init_by_defaults() function to not leak memory in
	  case if
	    error.

	  on some systems" (http://curl.haxx.se/bug/view.cgi?id=1999181).
	  The problem was that the configure script did not use the
	  _POSIX_MONOTONIC_CLOCK feature test macro when checking monotonic
	  clock availability. This is now fixed and the monotonic clock
	  will not be used unless the feature test macro is defined with a
	  value greater than zero indicating always supported.

2008-06-22 22:38  bagder

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES, lib/http.c, tests/data/Makefile.am,
	  tests/data/test1032: - Eduard Bloch filed the debian bug report
	  #487567
	  (http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=487567)
	  pointing out that   libcurl used Content-Range: instead of Range
	  when doing a range request with   --head (CURLOPT_NOBODY). This
	  is now fixed and test case 1032 was added to	 verify.

2008-06-22 08:57  danf

	* CHANGES, lib/parsedate.c, lib/url.c: Stopped using ranges in
	  scanf character sequences (e.g. %[a-z]) since that is not ANSI C,
	  just a common extension.  This caused problems on at least Open
	  Watcom C.

2008-06-21 23:21  bagder

	* lib/Makefile.am: Oops, that was an experimental change not meant
	  to be committed!

2008-06-21 23:19  bagder

2008-06-20 20:09  yangtse

	* CHANGES, acinclude.m4, configure.ac, ares/acinclude.m4,
	  ares/configure.ac: Modified configuration script to actually
	  verify if the compiler is good enough at detecting compilation
	  errors or at least it has been properly configured to do so.
	  Configuration heavily depends on this capability, so if this
	  compiler sanity check fails the configuration process will now
	  fail.

2008-06-20 13:15  bagder

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES, lib/nss.c: - Phil Pellouchoud found a
	  case where libcurl built with NSS failed to	handshake with a
	  SSLv2 server, and it turned out to be because it didn't
	  recognize the cipher named "rc4-md5". In our list that cipher was
	  named   plainly "rc4". I've now added rc4-md5 to work as an alias
	  as Phil reported   that it made things work for him again.

2008-06-20 12:45  bagder

	* lib/ssh.h: remove leftover proto that isn't used, I made it a

2008-06-20 12:43  bagder

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES, lib/sendf.c, lib/sendf.h, lib/socks.c,
	  lib/ssh.h: - Hans-Jurgen May pointed out that trying SCP or SFTP
	  over a SOCKS proxy   crashed libcurl. This is now addressed by
	  making sure we use "plain send"   internally when doing the socks
	  handshake instead of the Curl_write()   function which is
	  designed to use the "target" protocol. That's then SCP or   SFTP
	  in this case. I also took the opportunity and cleaned up some
	  ssh-	 related #ifdefs in the code for readability.

	* CHANGES: minor language fix

2008-06-19 23:32  bagder

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES, lib/multi.c: - Christopher Palow fixed a
	  curl_multi_socket() issue which previous caused   libcurl to not
	  tell the app properly when a socket was closed (when the name
	  resolve done by c-ares is done) and then immediately re-created
	  and put to   use again (for the actual connection). Since the
	  closure will make the   "watch status" get lost in several
	  event-based systems libcurl will need to   tell the app about
	  this close/re-create case.

2008-06-19 10:31  bagder

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES, lib/url.c: - Dengminwen found a bug in
	  the connection re-use function when using the   multi interface
	  with pipelining enabled as it would wrongly check for,   detect
	  and close "dead connections" even though that connection was
	  already   in use!

2008-06-19 07:47  bagder

	* lib/nss.c: Removed the #define of ciphernum since keeping a
	  define updated to be the number of entries in a provided table is
	  doomed to fail in the long run. Now we use the NUM_OF_CIPHERS
	  define instead to figure out the amount.

2008-06-19 07:42  bagder

	* lib/nss.c: s/strcasecmp/strequal to make it more portable

2008-06-19 03:12  danf

2008-06-19 00:01  bagder

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES, lib/nss.c: - Rob Crittenden brought a fix
	  for the NSS layer that makes libcurl no longer   always fire up a
	  new connection rather than using the existing one when the
	  multi interface is used. Original bug report:
	  https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=450140

2008-06-18 23:50  bagder

	* lib/nss.c: removed warning about unused argument by simply
	  removing that argument from the check_issuer_cert() proto

2008-06-18 23:48  bagder

	* lib/nss.c: check_issuer_cert() now builds and there's one warning
	  less. Still one compiler warning in the code though but we need
	  NSS' base64.h header for that and we don't currently have a
	  suitable way to include it as our own base64.h header kind of
	  "blocks" it.

2008-06-18 06:39  yangtse

	* CHANGES, acinclude.m4, ares/acinclude.m4: No longer break out of
	  a shell "for" statement from inside AC_FOO_IFELSE macros,

	  Identation adjustment.

2008-06-13 23:16  bagder

	* lib/multi.c: In checkPendPipeline() we can't be setting the
	  TIMER_CONNECT correctly as that is for the TCP connect. I changed
	  it to TIMER_PRETRANSFER which seems to be what was intended here.

	* CHANGES, lib/gtls.h, lib/nss.c, lib/nssg.h, lib/qssl.h,
	  lib/sslgen.c, lib/sslgen.h, lib/ssluse.c, lib/ssluse.h: - I did a
	  cleanup of the internal generic SSL layer and how the various SSL
	    libraries are supported. Starting now, each underlying SSL
	  library support   code does a set of defines for the 16 functions
	  the generic layer (sslgen.c)	 uses (all these new function
	  defines use the prefix "curlssl_"). This   greatly simplified the
	  generic layer in readability by involving much less	#ifdefs and
	  other preprocessor stuff and should make it easier for people to
	   make libcurl work with new SSL libraries.

	    Hopefully I can later on document these 16 functions somewhat
	  as well.

	    I also made most of the internal SSL-dependent functions (using
	  Curl_ssl_
	    prefix) #defined to nothing when no SSL support is requested -
	  previously
	    they would unnecessarily call mostly empty functions.

2008-06-11 17:26  yangtse

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES, docs/curl.1, src/main.c,
	  tests/runtests.pl, tests/data/test256, tests/data/test38: - curl
	  the tool now deals with its command line options somewhat
	  differently!	 All boolean options (such as -O, -I, -v etc), both
	  short and long versions,   now always switch on/enable the option
	  named. Using the same option multiple   times thus make no
	  difference. To switch off one of those options, you need   to use
	  the long version of the option and type --no-OPTION. Like to
	  disable   verbose mode you use --no-verbose!

	  - Added --remote-name-all to curl, which if used changes the
	  default for all   given URLs to be dealt with as if -O is used.
	  So if you want to disable that   for a specific URL after
	  --remote-name-all has been used, you muse use -o -   or
	  --no-remote-name.

	  WAITDO but
	      rather go straight to DO

	    o we had multiple states for which the internal function
	  returned no socket
	      at all to wait for, with the effect that libcurl calls the
	  socket callback
	      (when curl_multi_socket() is used) with REMOVE prematurely
	  (as it would be
	      added again within very shortly)

	    o when in DO and DOING states, the HTTP and HTTPS protocol
	  handler functions
	      didn't return that the socket should be waited for writing,
	  but instead it
	      was treated as if no socket was needing monitoring so again
	  REMOVE was
	      called prematurely.

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES, lib/transfer.c, tests/data/Makefile.am,
	  tests/data/test1030: - Ben Van Hof filed bug report #1945240:
	  "libcurl sometimes sends body twice	when using CURL_AUTH_ANY"
	  (http://curl.haxx.se/bug/view.cgi?id=1945240).    The problem was
	  that when libcurl rewound a stream meant for upload when it
	  would prepare for a second request, it could accidentally
	  continue the	  sending of the rewound data on the first request
	  instead of on the second.    Ben also provided test case 1030
	  that verifies this fix.

2008-05-03 23:44  bagder

	* lib/http.c: Added comments, check Curl_http_auth_act()'s return
	  code and added a check that closes the connection somewhat faster
	  when perhapsrewind() has marked the connection for closure.

2008-05-03 15:43  bagder

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES, lib/connect.c: - Jean-Francois Bertrand
	  reported a libcurl crash with CURLOPT_TCP_NODELAY   since libcurl
	  used getprotobyname() and that isn't thread-safe. We now
	  switched to use IPPROTO_TCP unconditionally, but perhaps the
	  proper fix is   to detect the thread-safe version of the function
	  and use that.    http://curl.haxx.se/mail/lib-2008-05/0011.html

2008-05-01 23:34  bagder

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES, configure.ac, lib/connect.c: - Bart

	  lib/url.c, lib/urldata.h, src/writeout.c, tests/data/Makefile.am,
	  tests/data/test1029: - To make it easier for applications that
	  want lots of magic stuff done on   redirections and thus cannot
	  use CURLOPT_FOLLOWLOCATION easily, we now   introduce the new
	  CURLINFO_REDIRECT_URL option that lets applications	extract the
	  URL libcurl would've redirected to if it had been told to. This
	  then enables the application to continue to that URL as it thinks
	  is   suitable, without having to re-implement the magic of
	  creating the new URL	 from the Location: header etc. Test 1029
	  verifies it.

	  complained about the FTP error   message when libcurl doesn't get

	  specific on what the problem is. Also worth noticing:   while the
	  bug report contains an example where the response is:

	      421 There are too many connected users, please try again
	  later

	    we cannot assume that the error message will always be this

2008-03-30 11:08  bagder

	* TODO-RELEASE: 132 - Xponaut's CURLFORM_STREAM option to
	  curl_formadd()

2008-03-30 11:07  bagder

	* TODO-RELEASE: I'm officially pushing the two remaining issues to
	  the next release instead, since they're still not clear enough to
	  be to sort about before 7.18.1

2008-03-28 19:19  danf

	* tests/libtest/test1022.pl: Made the test work on perl 5.00

2008-03-28 00:13  bagder

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES: - Stephen Collyer pointed out that
	  configure --with-libssh2 without a given   path didn't work
	  properly but now it does!

2008-03-28 00:10  bagder

	* configure.ac: fix --with-libssh2 when given without path

2008-03-27 14:07  bagder

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES, TODO-RELEASE, lib/http.c: - As found out
	  and reported by Dan Petitt, libcurl didn't show progress/call
	  the progress callback for the first (potentially huge) piece of
	  body data   sent together with the POST request headers in the
	  initial send().

2008-03-25 20:23  bagder

	* RELEASE-NOTES: spell!

2008-03-25 20:19  bagder

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES, lib/url.c: - Made setting the
	  CURLOPT_SSL_CTX_FUNCTION option return a failure in case
	  libcurl wasn't built to use OpenSSL as that is a prerequisite for
	  this	 option to function!

2008-03-25 20:17  bagder

	* docs/libcurl/curl_easy_setopt.3: spell it out loudly and clearly
	  that CURLOPT_SSL_CTX_FUNCTION is only functional if libcurl is
	  built against OpenSSL

2008-03-22 23:00  bagder

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES, TODO-RELEASE, lib/transfer.c,
	  tests/data/DISABLED: - Fixed the problem with doing a zero byte
	  SCP transfer, verified with test   case 617 (which was added by
	  Daniel Fandrich 5 Mar 2008).

2008-03-21 12:53  bagder

	* TODO-RELEASE: roadmap ahead

2008-03-20 21:16  danf

	* RELEASE-NOTES: Jes reported the curl-config bug

2008-03-20 21:08  danf

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES, configure.ac: Fixed a problem where
	  curl-config --protocols could erroneously show LDAPS support when
	  curl didn't even have regular LDAP support.  It looks like this
	  could happen when the --enable-ldaps configure switch is given
	  but configure couldn't find the LDAP headers or libraries.

2008-03-20 17:10  gknauf

	* tests/testcurl.pl: added --extvercmd parameter which can be used
	  to specify an external command to display 'curl --version', f.e.
	  with MinW32 crosscompile --extvercmd=/usr/bin/wine can be used.

2008-03-20 09:09  mmarek

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES, acinclude.m4, configure.ac,
	  lib/Makefile.am, lib/easy.c, lib/url.c: - Added
	  --with-ca-path=DIRECTORY configure option to use an openSSL
	  CApath by   default instead of a ca bundle. The configure script
	  will also look for a	 ca path if no ca bundle is found and no
	  option given.

	  - Fixed detection of previously installed curl-ca-bundle.crt

2008-03-18 23:59  danf

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES, lib/ssh.c, tests/data/DISABLED,
	  tests/data/test626: Fixed an infinite loop when given an invalid
	  SFTP quote command.

2008-03-18 18:05  danf

	* CHANGES, tests/data/DISABLED, tests/data/Makefile.am,
	  tests/data/test626: Added test 626 to reproduce an infinite loop
	  when given an invalid SFTP quote command reported by Vincent Le
	  Normand, but left it disabled.

2008-03-18 09:14  mmarek

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES, include/curl/curl.h,
	  include/curl/typecheck-gcc.h, lib/easy.c, lib/multi.c,
	  lib/share.c: - Added curl_easy_getinfo typechecker.

	  - Added macros for curl_share_setopt and curl_multi_setopt to
	  check at least   the correct number of arguments.

2008-03-17 15:22  mmarek

	* include/curl/typecheck-gcc.h: Mark the statement expr with
	  __extension__ so that gcc -pedantic doesn't emit any
	  hard-to-grasp warnings in curl_easy_setopt() calls in
	  applications.  Also delete superfluous semicolons.

2008-03-15 02:03  danf

	* tests/libtest/test610.pl: Spell the commands right

2008-03-13 23:51  danf

	* CHANGES, tests/data/Makefile.am, tests/data/test622,
	  tests/data/test623, tests/data/test624, tests/data/test625,
	  tests/libtest/test610.pl: Added tests 622-625 to test SFTP/SCP
	  uploads. Test 625 was an attempt to reproduce the
	  --ftp-create-dirs problem reported by Brian Ulm, but that seems
	  to need a call curl_easy_reset() which this test case doesn't do.

2008-03-13 22:43  bagder

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES: - Brian Ulm figured out that if you did
	  an SFTP upload with	CURLOPT_FTP_CREATE_MISSING_DIRS to create a
	  directory, and then re-used the   handle and uploaded another
	  file to another directory that needed to be	created, the second
	  upload would fail. Another case of a state variable that   wasn't
	  properly reset between requests.

	  - I rewrote the 100-continue code to use a single state variable
	  instead of   the previous two ones. I think it made the logic
	  somewhat clearer.

2008-03-13 22:43  bagder

	* lib/ssh.c: - Brian Ulm figured out that if you did an SFTP upload
	  with	 CURLOPT_FTP_CREATE_MISSING_DIRS to create a directory, and
	  then re-used the   handle and uploaded another file to another
	  directory that needed to be	created, the second upload would
	  fail. Another case of a state variable that	wasn't properly
	  reset between requests.

2008-03-13 21:56  bagder

	* lib/: transfer.c, urldata.h: Change the confusing two variables
	  for the expect 100 continue stuff into a single state variable to
	  make the code easier to follow and understand.

2008-03-13 21:49  danf

	* docs/curl.1: --ftp-create-dirs works on SFTP as well

2008-03-13 13:36  bagder

	* docs/examples/post-callback.c: fix code that is normally
	  #ifdef'ed out

2008-03-12 14:14  bagder

	* TODO-RELEASE: Done: 125 - Michal Marek's typechecker-gcc work

2008-03-11 23:58  bagder

	* tests/data/test506: updated according to the name resolve race
	  condition fix just committed

2008-03-11 23:55  bagder

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES, lib/hostip.c: - Dmitry Popov filed bug
	  report #1911069   (http://curl.haxx.se/bug/view.cgi?id=1911069)
	  that identified a race   condition in the name resolver code when
	  the DNS cache is shared between   multiple easy handles, each
	  running in simultaneous threads that could cause   crashes.

2008-03-11 14:14  bagder

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES, include/curl/curl.h: - Added a macro for
	  curl_easy_setopt() that accepts three arguments and simply   does
	  nothing with them, just to make sure libcurl users always use
	  three   arguments to this function. Due to its use of ... for the
	  third argument, it   is otherwise hard to detect abuse.

2008-03-11 13:18  bagder

	* docs/libcurl/curl_easy_setopt.3: Recommend passing a 1 as
	  parameter to CURLOPT_SSLENGINE_DEFAULT rather than a "dummy" just
	  to get things as fixed as possible in case we ever get the urge
	  to change this to actually mean something.

2008-03-11 08:37  mmarek

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES, docs/libcurl/curl_easy_setopt.3,
	  include/curl/Makefile.am, include/curl/curl.h,
	  include/curl/typecheck-gcc.h, lib/easy.c: - Added a type checking
	  macro for curl_easy_setopt(), needs gcc-4.3 and only	 works in C
	  mode atm (http://curl.haxx.se/mail/lib-2008-02/0267.html ,
	  http://curl.haxx.se/mail/lib-2008-02/0292.html )

	* CHANGES, tests/data/Makefile.am, tests/data/test618,
	  tests/data/test619, tests/data/test620, tests/data/test621: Added
	  tests 618-621 to test SFTP/SCP transfers of more than one file
	  (test 620 tests the just-fixed problem reported by Brian Ulm).

2008-03-10 15:32  mmarek

	* tests/README: fixed typo

2008-03-10 10:56  mmarek

	* configure.ac: (try to) use LIBS for libraries (-l) and LDFLAGS
	  for paths (-L) in the gssapi check. Cleans up curl-config --libs
	  output when REQUIRE_LIB_DEPS=no

2008-03-09 12:37  bagder

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES, lib/ssh.c: - Brian Ulm reported a crash
	  when doing a second SFTP transfer on a re-used   easy handle if
	  curl_easy_reset() was used between them. I fixed it and Brian
	  verified that it cured his problem.

	  - Brian Ulm reported that if you first tried to download a
	  non-existing SFTP   file and then fetched an existing one and
	  re-used the handle, libcurl would   still report the second one
	  as non-existing as well! I fixed it abd Brian   verified that it
	  cured his problem.

2008-03-08 23:19  bagder

	* TODO-RELEASE: Done: 123 - Mike Protts' SFTP resume download

2008-03-07 03:49  yangtse

	* lib/config-win32.h, lib/config-win32ce.h, src/config-win32.h:
	  VS2005 and later dafault size for time_t is 64-bit, unless
	  _USE_32BIT_TIME_T has been defined to get a 32-bit time_t

2008-03-06 18:22  mmarek

	* docs/libcurl/curl_multi_socket.3: spellchecked

2008-03-06 13:37  bagder

	* docs/libcurl/curl_multi_socket.3: curl_multi_timeout() is really
	  not recommended with curl_multi_socket()-based usage

2008-03-06 04:48  yangtse

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES, lib/select.c: Regression fix:

	  select/poll calls will only be retried upon EINTR failures as it
	  previously was in lib/select.c revision 1.29

	  In this way Curl_socket_ready() and Curl_poll() will again fail
	  on any select/poll errors different than EINTR.

2008-03-06 02:15  danf

	* CHANGES, tests/data/DISABLED, tests/data/Makefile.am,
	  tests/data/test616, tests/data/test617: Added tests 616 and 617
	  to see how SFTP and SCP cope with zero-length files, as
	  questioned by Mike Protts. SFTP does for me but SCP doesn't so
	  test 617 is disabled for now.

2008-03-06 02:11  danf

	* tests/: FILEFORMAT, runtests.pl: Fixed the test harness so it
	  will write out zero-length data files.

2008-03-05 19:27  yangtse

	* tests/server/sockfilt.c: fix log message used when unable to
	  connect to destination port

2008-03-04 12:53  bagder

	  that makes resumed transfers work with SFTP.

2008-03-01 23:32  bagder

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES, TODO-RELEASE, lib/http.c,
	  lib/http_negotiate.c: - Anatoli Tubman found and fixed a crash
	  with Negotiate authentication used on   a re-used connection
	  where both requests used Negotiate.

2008-02-29 18:13  yangtse

	* ares/configure.ac, configure.ac: Force AIX xlc to fail and not
	  generate object code if the source code has compiled with errors.
	  This behaviour is needed for autoconf macros which rely on the
	  ability to compile with or without errors, and is safer than
	  xlc's default of failing only upon severe errors.

2008-02-28 22:25  bagder

	* TODO-RELEASE: Removed:

	  121 - Kaspar Brand's and Guenter Knauf's work on the TLS
	  extension Server Name       Indication is now committed

	  122 - Progress callback not called during failed socket connect
	  with the multi       interface, is now simply pending a closure
	  since no feedback has been	   received lately.

	  Added:

	  123 - Mike Protts' SFTP resume download

	  124 - Anatoli Tubman's fix for a Negotiate: crash

	  125 - Michal Marek's typechecker-gcc work

2008-02-28 12:34  gknauf

	  tests/libtest/lib552.c: Michal Marek's cleanup of how
	  curl_easy_setopt() is used in examples and test code. Thanks to
	  his curl_easy_setopt() typechecker work...

2008-02-27 02:51  gknauf

	* ares/get_ver.awk: added get_ver.awk since c-ares is a standalone
	  project, and should therefore also compile when cURL is absent.

2008-02-27 02:43  gknauf

	* ares/Makefile.netware: a couple of small fixes to the makefile:
	  fixed comments; fixed INSTDIR define, simplified rules; changed
	  to use get_ver.awk in current dir rather than the curl one.

2008-02-27 02:36  gknauf

	* lib/Makefile.netware, src/Makefile.netware: another small change
	  to the makefiles to simplify rules.

2008-02-27 00:06  gknauf

2008-02-26 22:24  gknauf

	* lib/Makefile.netware: fixed install target to create a
	  ca-bundle.crt since we have no longer one in the project.

2008-02-26 19:13  yangtse

	* tests/server/sockfilt.c: all reads from stdin and writes to

2008-02-26 16:06  yangtse

	* tests/server/: sockfilt.c, sws.c, tftpd.c, util.c, util.h:

2008-02-22 10:31  yangtse

	* tests/server/sockfilt.c: Revert sockfilt.c back to revision 1.42

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES, lib/transfer.c: - Zmey Petroff found a
	  crash when libcurl accessed a NULL pointer, which   happened if
	  you set the connection cache size to 1 and for example failed to
	  login to an FTP site. Bug report #1896698

	  address a bug, we now keep   better control at the exact state of
	  the connection's SSL status so that we   know exactly when it has
	  completed the SSL negotiation or not so that there   won't be

	  CURLOPT_SSL_CTX_FUNCTION one treat that as if it was a Location:
	   following. The patch that introduced this feature was done for
	  7.11.0, but	this code and functionality has been broken since
	  about 7.15.4 (March 2006)   with the introduction of non-blocking
	  OpenSSL "connects".

	    It was a hack to begin with and since it doesn't work and
	  hasn't worked
	    correctly for a long time and nobody has even noticed, I
	  consider it a very
	    suitable subject for plain removal. And so it was done.

	* docs/examples/: Makefile.am, Makefile.inc: moved sample program
	  defines into separate Makefile.inc so that other makefiles can
	  pick up the defines from there.

2008-02-18 16:30  gknauf

	* lib/Makefile.netware, src/Makefile.netware: added check symbol
	  for linking with POSIX prelude.

2008-02-18 14:05  yangtse

	* lib/ssh.c: fix compiler warnings:

	    'enumerated type mixed with another type'

	  and

	    'variable was set but never used'

2008-02-18 12:40  bagder

	* docs/curl.1: just mention in --cacert that curl normally has a
	  default ca cert path built-in

2008-02-18 12:39  bagder

	* docs/FAQ: the ca-bundle is no longer shipped

2008-02-18 12:35  bagder

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES, acinclude.m4, configure.ac,
	  docs/SSLCERTS, lib/Makefile.am, lib/ca-bundle.crt: - We're no
	  longer providing a very old ca-bundle in the curl tarball. You
	  can	get a fresh one downloaded and created with 'make
	  ca-bundle' or you can get   one from here =>
	  http://curl.haxx.se/docs/caextract.html if you want a fresh	new
	  one extracted from Mozilla's recent list of ca certs.

	    The configure option --with-ca-bundle now lets you specify what
	  file to use
	    as default ca bundle for your build. If not specified, the
	  configure script
	    will check a few known standard places for a global ca cert to
	  use.

2008-02-17 14:49  bagder

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES: - Jerome Muffat-Meridol helped me fix
	  Curl_done() to close the current   connection by force when it
	  was called before the entire request is   completed, simply
	  because we can't know if the connection really can be   re-used
	  safely at that point.

2008-02-17 14:49  bagder

	* lib/http.c: rephrased comment

2008-02-17 14:43  bagder

	* lib/url.c: In Curl_done() if premature is TRUE, it means this
	  connection was said to be DONE before the entire request
	  operation is complete and thus we can't know in what state it is
	  for re-using, so we're forced to close it. In a perfect world we
	  can add code that keep track of if we really must close it here
	  or not, but currently we have no such detail knowledge.

	  Jerome Muffat-Meridol helped us work this out.

2008-02-17 14:40  bagder

	* lib/http.c: don't do the GOT_NOTHING error check if the DONE
	  function was called with premature set TRUE, which means it was
	  done before the request comleted. It could then very well not
	  have received any data.

2008-02-17 14:38  bagder

	* lib/multi.c: added a comment about the ignoring of the
	  Curl_done() return code

2008-02-17 05:36  yangtse

	* configure.ac, tests/server/sockfilt.c: sockfilt will quit when
	  orphaned

2008-02-16 14:44  bagder

	* lib/gtls.c: oops, that was debug code not meant to be committed
	  like this...

2008-02-16 14:41  bagder

	* lib/gtls.c: fix warnings about shadowing

2008-02-16 01:44  gknauf

	* lib/Makefile.netware, src/Makefile.netware: seems that curently
	  we dont need the imports from (l)ldapx.imp.

2008-02-16 01:21  gknauf

	* ares/Makefile.netware: fixed linker def file for tools when
	  compiled with gcc/nlmconv.

2008-02-16 01:15  gknauf

	* lib/Makefile.netware, src/Makefile.netware: re-ordered the module
	  dependency list; removed unsused ldap module dependency since the
	  module didnt autounload from protected address space.

2008-02-15 23:37  bagder

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES, lib/gtls.c: - Made the gnutls code path
	  not even try to get the server cert if no peer   verification is
	  requested. Previously it would even return failure if gnutls
	  failed to get the server cert even though no verification was
	  asked for.

	  - Fix my Curl_timeleft() leftover mistake in the gnutls code

2008-02-15 22:38  bagder

	* lib/url.c: mention that we explicitly ignore the return code

2008-02-15 10:29  bagder

	* RELEASE-NOTES: new mirror and mirror recount after cleansing

2008-02-15 09:56  bagder

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES, lib/http.c: - Pooyan McSporran found and
	  fixed a flaw where you first would do a normal   http request and
	  then you'd reuse the handle and replace the Accept: header,	as
	  then libcurl would send two Accept: headers!

2008-02-15 01:41  gknauf

	* lib/mk-ca-bundle.pl: fixed version var.

2008-02-15 01:26  gknauf

	* lib/mk-ca-bundle.pl: moved info block up before help block so
	  that it can also be displayed before help option; trial to add a
	  version number.

2008-02-14 22:24  gknauf

	* ares/Makefile.am: added some files which were missing in release
	  tarballs.

2008-02-14 11:14  bagder

	* TODO-RELEASE: five current issues we should deal with somehow
	  before the next release

2008-02-14 00:06  danf

	* CVS-INFO: Updated some out-of-date information.

2008-02-13 22:36  bagder

	* tests/libtest/lib509.c: make this test disabled properly when
	  built with yassl

2008-02-13 07:06  yangtse

	* tests/runtests.pl: verifyserver() actually returns the pid of the
	  unsecure http and ftp servers when verifying the https and ftps
	  servers

2008-02-12 14:47  yangtse

	* tests/runtests.pl: On heavily loaded systems any test server
	  start up can take longer than the timeout passed to startnew,
	  when this happens startnew completes without being able to read
	  the pidfile and consequently returns a zero pid2.

	  To fix the above posibility the server pid is recovered from the
	  verification stage which will actually return the server pid when
	  verification is valid.

2008-02-12 02:11  yangtse

	* tests/README: fix grammatical issues

2008-02-11 23:03  bagder

	* CHANGES, lib/qssl.c, lib/socks.c, lib/tftp.c: Yang Tse pointed
	  out a few remaining quirks from my timeout refactoring from Feb 7
	  that didn't abort properly on timeouts. These are actually old
	  problems but now they should be fixed.

2008-02-11 21:21  yangtse

	* tests/README: shell startup scripts and possible influence in
	  scp/sftp/socks tests

2008-02-11 21:10  danf

	* tests/runtests.pl: Disable test due to keyword before disabling
	  due to bad server.

2008-02-11 19:52  gknauf

	* lib/mk-ca-bundle.pl: open pipe to openssl commandline instead of
	  writing into temp file.

2008-02-11 19:27  danf

	* lib/tftp.c: Fixed unused variable warning.

2008-02-11 16:00  gknauf

	* lib/mk-ca-bundle.pl: added strict to make sure all vars are

	  optional; added -q switch to be really quiet.

2008-02-11 15:28  yangtse

	* tests/sshserver.pl: Additional SunSSH 1.1 ssh server options

2008-02-10 05:20  yangtse

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES, lib/hostthre.c: Bug report #1888932
	  (http://curl.haxx.se/bug/view.cgi?id=1888932) points out and
	  provides test program that demonstrates that libcurl might not
	  set error description message for error
	  CURLE_COULDNT_RESOLVE_HOST for Windows threaded name resolver
	  builds. Fixed now.

2008-02-10 03:52  yangtse

	* tests/runtests.pl: Verify only once test harness sftp server
	  connectivity and functionality.

	  Make sure that the sftp client tool uses the ssh client binary
	  that we have used to generate the configuration files, otherwise
	  sftp might be using one located in the preferred path compiled
	  into sftp.

2008-02-10 02:32  gknauf

	* Makefile.am, Makefile.dist: removed 'mv' call and changed to use
	  new backup feature of mk-ca-bundle.pl.

2008-02-10 02:29  gknauf

	* lib/mk-ca-bundle.pl: added -b switch to provide a backup
	  functionality for existing ca-bundle.crt file.

2008-02-09 16:32  gknauf

	* lib/mk-ca-bundle.pl: fixed another wrong var in error message.

2008-02-09 16:07  gknauf

	* Makefile.am, Makefile.dist: make use of mv's backup feature so
	  that calling the ca-bundle target more than once will never fail;
	  ignore error which can occure if for whatever reason there's no
	  orignial ca-bundle.crt to rename.

2008-02-09 16:00  gknauf

	* lib/mk-ca-bundle.pl: fixed wrong var in error message.

2008-02-09 03:37  danf

	* tests/data/: test164, test185, test29, test303: Fixed some XML
	  parsing problems.

2008-02-09 03:08  danf

	* CHANGES, tests/data/test146, tests/data/test183,
	  tests/data/test184, tests/data/test185, tests/data/test300,
	  tests/data/test301, tests/data/test302, tests/data/test304,
	  tests/data/test305, tests/data/test306, tests/data/test307,
	  tests/data/test308, tests/data/test509, tests/data/test94: Added
	  key words to all SSL-using tests so they can be skipped if
	  necessary.  Removed a few unnecessary requires SSL statements.

2008-02-09 03:01  danf

	* tests/data/test303: Fixed test to use HTTPS as documented.

2008-02-08 23:02  bagder

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES, lib/gtls.c: - Mike Hommey filed and fixed
	  bug report #1889856
	  (http://curl.haxx.se/bug/view.cgi?id=1889856): When using the
	  gnutls ssl   layer, cleaning-up and reinitializing curl ends up
	  with https requests	failing with "ASN1 parser: Element was not
	  found" errors. Obviously a   regression added in 7.16.3.

2008-02-08 22:04  gknauf

	* docs/SSLCERTS: fixed a typo.

2008-02-08 19:42  danf

	* tests/data/: test1022, test1023: Missed checking in these test
	  data files.

2008-02-08 18:32  yangtse

	* tests/sshserver.pl: Get rid of sftp subsystem additional
	  parameters, they aren't widely supported

2008-02-08 14:54  yangtse

	* CHANGES, tests/.cvsignore, tests/runtests.pl, tests/sshhelp.pm,
	  tests/sshserver.pl: To verify that the sftp server is actually
	  running, responsive and that all curl's tests generated
	  configuration and key files are fine, a real connection is
	  established to the test harness sftp server authenticating and
	  running a simple sftp remote pwd command.

	  The verification is done using OpenSSH's or SunSSH's sftp client
	  tool with a configuration file with the same options as the test
	  harness socks server with the exception that dynamic forwarding
	  is not used for sftp.

2008-02-08 12:20  bagder

	* docs/FAQ: and mention make ca-bundle in the 1.11 faq entry as
	  well

2008-02-08 12:18  bagder

	* docs/SSLCERTS: for step 5, mention that we can now generate an
	  own version locally if wanted instead of downloading it from the
	  curl site

2008-02-08 12:16  bagder

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES: Gnter Knauf added lib/mk-ca-bundle.pl
	  which gets the Firefox ca bundle and creates a suitable
	  ca-bundle.crt file in PEM format for use with curl. The
	  recommended way to run it is to use 'make ca-bundle' in the build
	  tree root.

2008-02-08 12:12  bagder

	* Makefile.am: oops, we make the copyright year ranges the simple
	  style

2008-02-08 12:11  bagder

	* Makefile.am: provide the ca-bundle target the same way as the
	  Makefile.dist does it so that it works the same way for
	  configure-based platforms as for non-configure ones

2008-02-08 10:56  bagder

	* lib/Makefile.am: include mk-ca-bundle.pl in the tarballs

2008-02-08 03:57  gknauf

	* Makefile.dist: added ca-bundle target to main makefile; for now
	  this does rename the existing ca-bundle.crt to ca-bundle.crt.old;
	  maybe we can remove this once we are 100% sure that the new
	  script works properly, and just overwrite the shipping one?

2008-02-08 03:38  gknauf

	* lib/mk-ca-bundle.pl: use argument to specify output filename if
	  present.

2008-02-08 02:58  gknauf

	* lib/mk-ca-bundle.pl: fixed regex to fetch certdata.txt version
	  since it was replaced by CVS (argh!) added a switch to display
	  certdata.txt version header.

2008-02-08 02:21  danf

	* CHANGES, tests/data/Makefile.am, tests/libtest/Makefile.am,
	  tests/libtest/test1013.pl, tests/libtest/test1022.pl: Added tests

	  --vernum

2008-02-08 02:08  gknauf

	* lib/mk-ca-bundle.pl: added Perl script to create a fresh
	  ca-bundle.crt.

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES, lib/connect.c, lib/connect.h, lib/ftp.c,
	  lib/gtls.c, lib/qssl.c, lib/socks.c, lib/ssluse.c, lib/tftp.c: -
	  Refactored a lot of timeout code into a few functions in an
	  attempt to make   them all use the same (hopefully correct) logic
	  to make it less error-prone	and easier to introduce
	  library-wide where it should be used.

2008-02-07 16:43  bagder

	* docs/FAQ, lib/ca-bundle.crt: ca-bundle.crt documentational
	  updates that more clearly describe the bundle ca-bundle.crt file
	  as outdated and in need for replacement by anyone who wants to
	  verify modern peers as the one we have is from year 2000!

2008-02-06 20:01  yangtse

2008-02-05 19:37  yangtse

	* tests/server/sws.c: Fix buffer size specification.

	  Improve handling of boundary conditions for huge requests.

2008-02-05 15:43  yangtse

	* tests/server/sws.c: Minor variable type cleanups.

	  Disable "swsbounce" mode when the received request isn't for the
	  same test and part number.

2008-02-05 03:21  yangtse

	* tests/server/sws.c: proper initialization of httprequest, no
	  longer zeroing out twice the whole 150000+ bytes struct, and also
	  removing an equally big additional buffer for pipelining
	  treatment.

2008-02-04 23:40  gknauf

	* CHANGES, lib/multi.c, lib/url.c, lib/urldata.h: - Dmitry
	  Kurochkin cleaned up the pipelining code and removed the need for
	  and	use of the "is_in_pipeline" struct field.

2008-02-03 13:28  bagder

	* docs/examples/: Makefile.am, threaded-ssl.c: threaded-ssl.c is a
	  little example that does multi-threaded downloads from HTTPS
	  sites with OpenSSL-enabled libcurl (and pthreads) and thus do the
	  thread-locking and things openssl-style.

2008-02-03 11:10  bagder

	* docs/libcurl/curl_multi_timeout.3: it is stable now...

2008-02-01 21:34  danf

2008-01-31 17:37  yangtse

	* tests/sshserver.pl: When possible, use additional config options

	  OpenSSH versions but are current for SunSSH.

2008-01-31 13:21  bagder

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES, lib/cookie.c, lib/cookie.h,

	  cookie support in libcurl properly deal with the   "HttpOnly"
	  feature introduced by Microsoft and apparently also supported by
	  Firefox: http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms533046.aspx
	  . HttpOnly   is now supported when received from servers in HTTP
	  headers, when written to   cookie jars and when read from
	  existing cookie jars.

2008-01-31 13:04  bagder

	* CHANGES, lib/file.c, lib/ftp.c, lib/http.c, lib/http_chunks.c,
	  lib/transfer.c, lib/url.c, lib/urldata.h: - Dmitry Kurochkin
	  moved several struct fields from the connectdata struct to   the
	  SingleRequest one to make pipelining better. It is a bit tricky
	  to keep   them in the right place, to keep things related to the
	  actual request or to	 the actual connection in the right place.

2008-01-31 12:36  bagder

	* docs/KNOWN_BUGS: bug 51 may possibly be fixed, and as such it is

	  51.Kevin Reed's reported problem with a proxy when doing CONNECT
	  and it   wants NTLM and close the connection to the initial
	  CONNECT response:   http://curl.haxx.se/bug/view.cgi?id=1879375

2008-01-30 00:46  gknauf

	* lib/Makefile.m32, src/Makefile.m32: silent stupid 'del' message

2008-01-26 00:33  bagder

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES, lib/http.c: - Kevin Reed filed bug report
	  #1879375   (http://curl.haxx.se/bug/view.cgi?id=1879375) which
	  describes how libcurl   got lost in this scenario: proxy tunnel
	  (or HTTPS over proxy), ask to do any	 proxy authentication and
	  the proxy replies with an auth (like NTLM) and then	closes the
	  connection after that initial informational response.

	    libcurl would not properly re-initialize the connection to the
	  proxy and
	    continue the auth negotiation like supposed. It does now
	  however, as it will
	    now detect if one or more authentication methods were available
	  and asked
	    for, and will thus retry the connection and continue from
	  there.

	  - I made the progress callback get called properly during proxy
	  CONNECT.

2008-01-25 23:35  bagder

	* docs/curl.1: using anyauth isn't unconditionally an extra
	  roundtrip

	  lib/multi.c, lib/transfer.c, lib/url.c, lib/url.h, lib/urldata.h,
	  tests/data/test530: Dmitry Kurochkin worked a lot on improving
	  the HTTP Pipelining support that previously had a number of
	  flaws, perhaps most notably when an application fired up N
	  transfers at once as then they wouldn't pipeline at all that
	  nicely as anyone would think... Test case 530 was also updated to
	  take the improved functionality into account.

2008-01-16 00:19  bagder

	  lib/qssl.c, lib/ssh.c, lib/ssluse.c, lib/tftp.c, lib/transfer.c:
	  Calls to Curl_failf() are not supposed to provide a trailing
	  newline as the function itself adds that. Fixed on 50 or
	  something strings!

2008-01-15 23:44  bagder

	* lib/: easy.c, hostip.c, hostip.h, url.c, urldata.h: Woops, partly
	  revert my previous commit and do it slightly differently instead.
	   The signalling of that a global DNS cache is wanted is done by
	  setting the option but the setting of the internal variable that
	  it is in use must not be done until it finally actually gets
	  used!

	  NOTE and WARNING: I noticed that you can't actually switch off
	  the global dns cache with CURLOPT_DNS_USE_GLOBAL_CACHE but you
	  couldn't do that previously either and the option is very clearly
	  and loudly documented as DO NOTE USE so I won't bother to fix
	  this bug now.

2008-01-15 23:15  bagder

	* CHANGES, docs/TODO, lib/hostip.c, lib/hostip.h, lib/url.c,
	  lib/urldata.h: I made the torture test on test 530 go through.
	  This was actually due to silly code left from when we switched to
	  let the multi handle "hold" the dns cache when using the multi
	  interface... Of course this only triggered when a certain
	  function call returned error at the correct moment.

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES, TODO-RELEASE, docs/curl.1, src/main.c:
	  Eric Landes provided the patch (edited by me) that introduces the
	  --keepalive-time to curl to set the keepalive probe interval. I
	  also took the opportunity to rename the recently added
	  no-keep-alive option to no-keepalive to keep a consistent naming
	  and to avoid getting two dashes in these option names. Eric also
	  provided an update to the man page for the new option.

	  Daniel Egger made CURLOPT_RANGE work on file:// URLs the very
	  same way it already worked for FTP:// URLs

2008-01-11 15:00  bagder

	* CHANGES, configure.ac, src/main.c: I made the curl tool switch
	  from using CURLOPT_IOCTLFUNCTION to now use the spanking new
	  CURLOPT_SEEKFUNCTION simply to take advantage of the improved
	  performance for the upload resume cases where you want to upload
	  the last few bytes of a very large file. To implement this
	  decently, I had to switch the client code for uploading from
	  fopen()/fread() to plain open()/read() so that we can use lseek()
	  to do >32bit seeks (as fseek() doesn't allow that) on systems
	  that offer support for that.

2008-01-10 23:14  bagder

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES, curl-config.in: Michal Marek made
	  curl-config --libs not include /usr/lib64 in the output (it
	  already before skipped /usr/lib).  /usr/lib64 is the default
	  library directory on many 64bit systems and it's unlikely that
	  anyone would use the path privately on systems where it's not.

	  include/curl/curl.h, lib/ftp.c, lib/http.c, lib/transfer.c,
	  lib/url.c, lib/urldata.h, src/main.c: Georg Lippitsch brought
	  CURLOPT_SEEKFUNCTION and CURLOPT_SEEKDATA to allow libcurl to
	  seek in a given input stream. This is particularly important when
	  doing upload resumes when there's already a huge part of the file
	  present remotely. Before, and still if this callback isn't used,
	  libcurl will read and through away the entire file up to the
	  point to where the resuming begins (which of course can be a slow
	  opereration depending on file size, I/O bandwidth and more). This
	  new function will also be preferred to get used instead of the
	  CURLOPT_IOCTLFUNCTION for seeking back in a stream when doing
	  multi-stage HTTP auth with POST/PUT.

2008-01-10 10:17  bagder

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES, lib/http_digest.c: Nikitinskit Dmitriy

2008-01-08 20:18  yangtse

	* tests/sshserver.pl: Remove increased loglevel intended to debug
	  autobuild's publickey authentication failures when using OpenSSH
	  2.9.9 or SunSSH.

	  Verified fact: Even when only using publickey authentication,
	  OpenSSH and SunSSH first validate the user, this implies that if
	  the user validation fails, 'invalid user', the publickey
	  authentication will not be allowed to complete.

	  where he pointed out that libcurl's date parser didn't accept a

	  docs/libcurl/curl_easy_setopt.3, include/curl/curl.h,
	  lib/socks.c, lib/url.c, lib/urldata.h, src/main.c: Based on
	  further discussion on curl-library, I reverted yesterday's SOCKS5
	  code to instead introduce support for a new proxy type called
	  CURLPROXY_SOCKS5_HOSTNAME that is used to send the host name to
	  the proxy instead of IP address and there's thus no longer any
	  need for a new curl_easy_setopt() option.

	  The default SOCKS5 proxy is again back to sending the IP address
	  to the proxy.  The new curl command line option for enabling
	  sending host name to a SOCKS5 proxy is now --socks5-hostname.

	* tests/sshserver.pl: 'LocalCommand' no longer used for ssh client
	  config file. When used it requires a non blank argument.

2008-01-03 21:48  yangtse

	* CHANGES, TODO-RELEASE, tests/Makefile.am, tests/runtests.pl,
	  tests/sshhelp.pm, tests/sshserver.pl: Modify test harness so that
	  the minimum SSH version required to run SCP, SFTP and SOCKS4
	  tests is now OpenSSH 2.9.9 or SunSSH 1.0

	  For SOCKS5 tests minimum versions are OpenSSH 3.7 or SunSSH 1.0

	* lib/: ftp.c, url.c: 'false' and 'true' are not built-ins on most

2008-01-02 23:46  bagder

	* TODO-RELEASE: one gone, one added

2008-01-02 23:30  bagder

	* CHANGES, lib/http_chunks.c: - I fixed two cases of missing return
	  code checks when handling chunked   decoding where a write error
	  (or abort return from a callback) didn't stop   libcurl's
	  processing.

2008-01-02 23:23  bagder

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES, include/curl/curl.h: I removed the
	  socklen_t use from the public curl/curl.h header and instead made
	  it an unsigned int. The type was only used in the curl_sockaddr
	  struct definition (only used by the curl_opensocket_callback). On
	  all platforms I could find information about, socklen_t is 32
	  unsigned bits large so I don't think this will break the API or
	  ABI. The main reason for this change is of course for all the
	  platforms that don't have a socklen_t definition in their headers
	  to build fine again. Providing our own configure magic and custom
	  definition of socklen_t on those systems proved to work but was a
	  lot of cruft, code and extra magic needed - when this very small
	  change of type seems harmless and still solves the missing
	  socklen_t problem.

2008-01-02 22:40  bagder

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES, docs/curl.1,
	  docs/libcurl/curl_easy_setopt.3, include/curl/curl.h, lib/ftp.c,
	  lib/socks.c, lib/socks.h, lib/url.c, src/main.c: Richard Atterer
	  brought a patch that added support for SOCKS4a proxies, which is
	  an inofficial PROXY4 variant that sends the hostname to the proxy
	  instead of the resolved address (which is already supported by
	  SOCKS5).  --socks4a is the curl command line option for it and
	  CURLOPT_PROXYTYPE can now be set to CURLPROXY_SOCKS4A as well.

	  --libcurl generated a source code with an int function but
	  without a return statement. While fixing that, I also took care
	  about adding some better comments for the generated code.

2007-12-27 22:44  bagder

	  flaw (http://curl.haxx.se/mail/lib-2007-12/0252.html) in

	* CHANGES, tests/data/Makefile.am, tests/data/test552,

	  to repeat the problem in bug report #1850730
	  (http://curl.haxx.se/bug/view.cgi?id=1850730) I wrote up test
	  case 552. The test is doing a 70K POST with a read callback and
	  an ioctl callback over a proxy requiring Digest auth. The test
	  case code is more or less identical to the test recipe code
	  provided by Spacen Jasset (who submitted the bug report).

	  report #1856628 (http://curl.haxx.se/bug/view.cgi?id=1856628) and
	  provided a fix for the (small) memory leak in the SSL session ID

	  triggered when retrying a download with curl.

2007-12-18 19:08  yangtse

	* CHANGES, ares/config-win32.h, lib/config-win32.h,
	  src/config-win32.h: MSVC 9.0 (VS2008) does not support Windows
	  build targets prior to WinXP, and makes wrong asumptions of build
	  target when it isn't specified. So, if no build target has been
	  defined we will target WinXP when building with MSVC 9.0
	  (VS2008).

2007-12-17 22:19  bagder

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES, lib/config-win32.h: Mateusz Loskot
	  pointed out that VC++ 9.0 (2008) has the pollfd struct and
	  defines in the SDK somehow differently so we have to add a define
	  to the config-win32.h file to make select.h compile nicely.

	  #1849764 (http://curl.haxx.se/bug/view.cgi?id=1849764) with an
	  included fix. He identified a problem for re-used connections
	  that previously had sent Expect: 100-continue and in some
	  situations the subsequent POST (that didn't use Expect:) still
	  had the internal flag set for its use. David's fix (that makes
	  the setting of the flag in every single request unconditionally)
	  is fine and is now used!

2007-12-12 12:22  bagder

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES, TODO-RELEASE, docs/curl.1, src/main.c:
	  Gilles Blanc made the curl tool enable SO_KEEPALIVE for the

	  that on demand.

	* docs/libcurl/curl_multi_timeout.3: clarify that when
	  curl_multi_timeout() returns -1 it just means that there is no

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES, lib/http.c, tests/data/test547,
	  tests/data/test548, tests/libtest/lib547.c: Spacen Jasset
	  reported a problem with doing POST (with data read with a
	  callback) over a proxy when NTLM is used as auth with the proxy.
	  The bug also concerned Digest and was limited to using callback
	  only. Spacen worked with us to provide a useful patch. I added
	  the test case 547 and 548 to verify two variations of POST over
	  proxy with NTLM.

2007-12-05 12:10  bagder

2007-12-03 10:50  bagder

	* tests/data/: test208, test79: removed the ;type= thing for FTP

	  Marek introduced CURLOPT_PROXY_TRANSFER_MODE which is used to
	  control the appending of the "type=" thing on FTP URLs when they
	  are passed to a HTTP proxy. Some proxies just don't like that
	  appending (which is done unconditionally in 7.17.1), and some
	  proxies treat binary/ascii transfers better with the appending
	  done!

2007-11-26 15:26  yangtse

	* tests/runtests.pl: Stop ssh and socks servers when verification

2007-11-26 15:07  yangtse

	* tests/runtests.pl: Providing an explicit bind address besides the
	  port for dynamic application-level port forwarding, our socks
	  port, prevents ssh from running on some systems.

	  By default, ssh binds local port forwardings to the loopback
	  address, since this was the address being given as the explicit
	  bind address, now it isn't given.

	* lib/: content_encoding.c, content_encoding.h, dict.c, easy.c,
	  file.c, ftp.c, http.c, http_chunks.c, multi.c, progress.c, ssh.c,
	  telnet.c, tftp.c, transfer.c, url.c, urldata.h: struct HandleData
	  is now called struct SingleRequest, and is only for data that is
	  inited at the start of the DO action. I removed the
	  Curl_transfer_keeper struct completely, and I had to move out a
	  few struct members (that had to be set before DO or used after
	  DONE) to the UrlState struct. The SingleRequest struct is
	  accessed with SessionHandle->req.

	  One of the biggest reasons for doing this was the bunch of
	  duplicate struct members in HandleData and Curl_transfer_keeper
	  since it was really messy to keep track of two variables with the
	  same name and basically the same purpose!

2007-11-23 13:18  yangtse

	  data/test1014: Revert last change since it breaks running the
	  test suite when builddir is different from srcdir.

2007-11-23 05:03  yangtse

	* tests/: ftpserver.pl, httpserver.pl, runtests.pl, data/test1013,
	  data/test1014: Improve chance of running runtests.pl from outside
	  the source tree 'tests' directory

2007-11-22 20:56  yangtse

	* tests/runtests.pl: Debugging messages to trace startnew failures

2007-11-22 17:35  yangtse

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES, include/curl/curl.h: Provide a socklen_t
	  definition in curl.h for Win32 API build targets which don't have
	  one.

2007-11-22 10:39  bagder

	* src/main.c: make nlen a size_t to better hold diffs between
	  pointers etc

2007-11-22 10:36  bagder

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES, docs/curl.1, src/main.c: Alessandro
	  Vesely helped me improve the --data-urlencode's syntax, parser
	  and documentation.

2007-11-21 23:37  bagder

	* lib/url.c: Make the do_complete() function not get called until
	  the DO actually is compelete, which bascially means when used
	  with the multi interface

2007-11-21 20:33  yangtse

	* tests/runtests.pl: Temporary change adding additional debugging
	  messages to better pinpoint startup failures of test suite ssh
	  and socks servers.

2007-11-21 18:50  yangtse

	* tests/httpsserver.pl: Fix trying to return outside of a

	* ares/: CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES, ares_version.h: and we start on
	  1.5.2!

2007-11-21 11:12  bagder

	* ares/CHANGES: change

2007-11-21 11:12  bagder

	* ares/: Makefile.inc, RELEASE-NOTES: oops

2007-11-21 10:31  bagder

2007-11-21 10:24  bagder

	* ares/RELEASE-NOTES: this is what 1.5.0 is

2007-11-21 00:17  bagder

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES, TODO-RELEASE, lib/http_negotiate.c,
	  lib/urldata.h: While inspecting the Negotiate code, I noticed how
	  the proxy auth was using the same state struct as the host auth,
	  so both could never be used at the same time! I fixed it (without
	  being able to check) to use two separate structs to allow
	  authentication using Negotiate on host and proxy simultanouesly.

2007-11-21 00:16  bagder

	* docs/libcurl/curl_easy_setopt.3: clarify somewhat what happens to
	  some data when a share is set to be used

2007-11-21 00:02  bagder

	* lib/: easy.c, http.c, http_negotiate.c: white space changes only
	  to clean up indent and source width

2007-11-20 23:59  bagder

	* lib/url.c: remove the unconditional enabling of cookies if you
	  set a share to use!

2007-11-20 23:57  bagder

	* lib/urldata.h: a bunch of new comments

2007-11-20 23:01  bagder

	* docs/curl.1: rephrased

2007-11-20 17:47  yangtse

	* tests/sshserver.pl: Don't gather additional debug info unless
	  sshd actually fails

2007-11-20 15:23  patrickm

	* docs/BINDINGS: ILE RPG binding: OS/400 specific and contained in
	  source distribution

2007-11-20 15:10  yangtse

	* tests/sshserver.pl: Improve detection of sshd un/supported
	  options.

	  Gather additional debug info when the test suite ssh server fails
	  to start.

2007-11-20 11:08  bagder

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES, docs/curl.1, src/main.c: Introuced
	  --data-urlencode to the curl tool for easier url encoding of the
	  data sent in a post.

2007-11-20 11:03  bagder

	* lib/mprintf.c: fix the treatment of the parameter-based
	  precision, as in "%.*s%s" as previously the second %s would
	  wrongly get the numerical argument that is used for the variable
	  precision for the first %s...

2007-11-20 10:44  bagder

	* TODO-RELEASE: 107 - resolve the type= thing for FTP URLs over

2007-11-20 00:20  bagder

	* TODO-RELEASE: 106 - Share interface force-enable the cookie
	  parser

2007-11-19 18:20  yangtse

	* tests/: runtests.pl, sshserver.pl: This is a temporary change to
	  test if OpenSSH 3.6 and SunSSH 1.1 are good/compatible enough to
	  run the test suite ssh server and socks tests

2007-11-19 16:47  bagder

	* ares/: ares_ipv6.h, bitncmp.h, inet_net_pton.h, inet_ntop.h: fill
	  in missing copyrights

2007-11-19 10:24  bagder

	* lib/sslgen.c: I think this is the right fix for other non-OpenSSL
	  libs, based on the NSS fix from the other day. It is time to
	  setup the internal SSL libs and treat them with a "handler"
	  struct similar to how we deal with the protocols these days...

2007-11-19 02:49  yangtse

	* tests/sshserver.pl: Temporary change to help debugging string(s)
	  returned by sshd -V when sshd is not being identified as an
	  OpenSSH daemon

2007-11-18 23:48  gknauf

	* ares/Makefile.netware, lib/Makefile.netware,
	  src/Makefile.netware: removed now obsolete defines; updated
	  external library versions to latest.

2007-11-18 10:45  bagder

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES, lib/sslgen.c: Rob Crittenden fixed SSL
	  connections with NSS done with the multi-interface

2007-11-18 02:16  yangtse

	* tests/sshserver.pl: Add /opt/ssh/sbin and /opt/ssh/libexec to the
	  sshd locations search list.

	  Improve wording of a couple of debug messages.

2007-11-17 18:43  yangtse

	* tests/sshserver.pl: When unable to start test suite sshserver,
	  log if OpenSSH has not been found or the OpenSSH version found

2007-11-17 11:22  bagder

	* CHANGES, configure.ac, docs/examples/Makefile.am: Andres Garcia
	  made the examples build fine on Windows (mingw + msys) when the
	  lib was built staticly.

2007-11-17 03:28  yangtse

	* tests/sshserver.pl: Add /usr/local/sbin and /usr/freeware/bin to
	  the sshd locations search list

2007-11-17 00:06  bagder

	* CHANGES, tests/runtests.pl: Michal Marek made the test suite
	  remember what test servers that fail to start so that subsequent
	  tries are simply skipped.

2007-11-16 10:36  sesse

	* ares/ares_parse_aaaa_reply.c: Fix a double free.

2007-11-16 02:19  yangtse

	* lib/http.c: Fix unsigned integral math check in add_buffer_send()

2007-11-16 00:42  bagder

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES, lib/http.c: Ates Goral identified a
	  problem in http.c:add_buffer_send() when a debug callback was
	  used, as it could wrongly pass on a bad size for the outgoing
	  HTTP header. The bad size would be a very large value as it was a
	  wrapped size_t content. This happened when the whole HTTP request
	  failed to get sent in one single send.
	  http://curl.haxx.se/mail/lib-2007-11/0165.html

2007-11-16 00:30  bagder

	* lib/http.c: removed unnecessary check from add_buffer_send() that
	  only was made within #ifdef CURL_DOES_CONVERSIONS anyway! I
	  turned it into a DEBUGASSERT() instead.

2007-11-15 23:41  bagder

	* CHANGES, tests/runtests.pl: Michal Marek fixed the test suite to
	  better deal with the case when the HTTP ipv6 server can't run.

2007-11-15 22:45  bagder

	* lib/: file.c, http_chunks.c, multi.c, tftp.c, transfer.c,
	  transfer.h, url.c, urldata.h: Rearranged code and changed
	  Curl_readwrite_init() and Curl_pre_readwrite() into do_init() and
	  do_complete() which now are called first and last in the DO
	  function. It simplified the flow in multi.c and the functions got
	  more sensible names!

2007-11-15 20:44  yangtse

	* ares/: ahost.c, ares.h, ares_ipv6.h, ares_parse_a_reply.c,
	  ares_parse_aaaa_reply.c, config-win32.h, nameser.h: Needed now
	  that in6_addr is referenced in ares.h

2007-11-15 14:20  yangtse

	* tests/server/tftpd.c: Replace isupper with our uppercase macro
	  version

2007-11-15 14:12  yangtse

	* src/main.c: Replace isgraph with our uppercase macro version

2007-11-15 12:03  bagder

	* lib/transfer.c: Make the Transfer() function return earlier
	  without doing any initializations for the cases where there's
	  nothing to do in here, like for SFTP directory listings that
	  already is complete when this function gets called. The init
	  stuff clears byte counters which isn't really desired.

2007-11-15 10:16  sesse

	* ares/ares_gethostbyname.c: When looking up in DNS and then in the
	  hosts file, return the error code from DNS if both fail, instead
	  of returning the error code from the hosts file, as today. Patch
	  from the Google tree.

2007-11-15 09:36  sesse

	* ares/: ares.h, ares_gethostbyname.c, ares_parse_a_reply.3,
	  ares_parse_a_reply.c, ares_parse_aaaa_reply.3,
	  ares_parse_aaaa_reply.c: Return TTL data from
	  ares_parse_{a,aaaa}_reply, if the user is so inclined. Patch from
	  the Google tree.

2007-11-14 23:44  bagder

	* lib/tftp.c: use the existing variable instead

2007-11-14 23:41  bagder

	* lib/tftp.c: Fix how TFTP connections are treated when re-used, if
	  the SessionHandle has been used for other protocols in between. I
	  found this when test 2004 started to fail for me!

2007-11-14 01:48  yangtse

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES, lib/http.c: Fix a variable potential
	  wrapping in add_buffer() when using absolutely huge send buffer
	  sizes

2007-11-13 00:04  bagder

	* CHANGES, lib/ssh.c, lib/urldata.h: Fixed a remaining problem with
	  doing SFTP directory listings on a re-used persistent connection.
	  Mentioned by Immanuel Gregoire on the mailing list.

2007-11-12 22:42  bagder

	* lib/url.c: comment language

2007-11-12 22:38  bagder

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES, lib/url.c: Bug report #1830637
	  (http://curl.haxx.se/bug/view.cgi?id=1830637), which was
	  forwarded from the Gentoo bug tracker by Daniel Black and was
	  originally submitted by Robin Johnson, pointed out that libcurl
	  would do bad memory references when it failed and bailed out
	  before the handler thing was setup. My fix is not done like the
	  provided patch does it, but instead I make sure that there's
	  never any chance for a NULL pointer in that struct member.

2007-11-12 10:24  bagder

	* lib/ssh.c: oops, fixed build when CURL_LIBSSH2_DEBUG is defined

2007-11-11 15:20  bagder

	* RELEASE-NOTES, docs/BINDINGS: new ruby binding, curl-multi
	  version 0.1

2007-11-08 20:28  yangtse

	* lib/url.c: Fix compiler warning: integral size mismatch in

2007-11-08 19:13  yangtse

	* ares/ares.h, ares/ares_private.h, ares/setup.h, lib/setup.h,
	  src/setup.h, include/curl/curl.h: Define WIN32 when build target

	  subset of WIN32.

2007-11-08 11:22  bagder

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES, lib/ssh.c, lib/urldata.h: Bug report
	  #1823487 (http://curl.haxx.se/bug/view.cgi?id=1823487) pointed
	  out that SFTP requests didn't use persistent connections. Neither
	  did SCP ones.  I gave the SSH code a good beating and now both
	  SCP and SFTP should use persistent connections fine. I also did a
	  bunch for indent changes as well as a bug fix for the "keyboard
	  interactive" auth.

2007-11-08 02:33  yangtse

	* ares/vc/: adig/adig.dsp, ahost/ahost.dsp: The only libraries
	  actually needed for sample programs adig and ahost are ws2_32.lib

2007-11-07 19:18  yangtse

	* ares/config-win32.h, lib/config-win32.h, lib/config-win32ce.h,

2007-11-07 06:52  danf

	* CHANGES, lib/telnet.c: Improved telnet support by drastically
	  reducing the number of write callbacks needed to pass a buffer to
	  the user.  Instead one per byte it is now as little as one per
	  segment.

2007-11-07 05:53  danf

	* docs/examples/getinmemory.c: Add a call to curl_global_cleanup to
	  show how to do a proper shutdown.

2007-11-06 18:18  yangtse

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES, include/curl/curl.h: Bug report #1824894
	  (http://curl.haxx.se/bug/view.cgi?id=1824894) pointed out a
	  problem in curl.h when building C++ apps with MSVC. To fix it,
	  the inclusion of header files in curl.h is moved outside of the
	  C++ extern "C" linkage block.

2007-11-06 17:20  giva

	* lib/strtoofft.h: Added prototype for _strtoi64().

2007-11-06 17:20  giva

	* lib/parsedate.c: Constified from arguments.

2007-11-05 21:54  danf

	* tests/libtest/test613.pl: Sort the directory listing because the
	  server doesn't always do it.

2007-11-05 21:53  danf

	* tests/data/: test1013, test1014: Added some keywords

	  select.c, sendf.c, socks.c, splay.c, ssluse.c, strtoofft.c,
	  telnet.c, transfer.c, url.c: removed space after if and while
	  before the parenthesis for better source code consistency

2007-11-05 10:31  bagder

	* docs/CONTRIBUTE: I check the code right now and while() and if()
	  are in majority over while () and if () so the rule is from now
	  on => no space before the parenthesis.

2007-11-05 10:30  bagder

	* lib/: ssh.c, urldata.h: Move connection-oriented variables from
	  the SessionHandle struct to the connectdata struct. This will in
	  theory enable us to do persistent connections with SCP+SFTP, but
	  currently the state machine always (and wrongly) cleanup
	  everything in the 'done' action instead of in 'disconnect'. Also
	  did a bunch of indent fixes, if () => if() and a few other source
	  cleanups like added comments etc.

2007-11-03 15:44  bagder

	* lib/multi.c: make sure the code deals with failures on the
	  DO_MORE state properly

2007-11-03 00:34  bagder

	* lib/ftp.c: avoid setting up a transfer when the state machine
	  failed previously

2007-11-01 22:49  bagder

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES, src/homedir.c: Toby Peterson patched a
	  memory problem in the command line tool that happened when a user
	  had a home dir as an empty string. curl would then do free() on a
	  wrong area.

2007-11-01 22:43  bagder

	* lib/ftp.c: minor re-indent

2007-11-01 22:20  danf

2007-11-01 04:09  danf

	* CHANGES, tests/data/Makefile.am, tests/data/test1013,
	  tests/data/test1014, tests/libtest/test1013.pl: Added test case

	* CHANGES, tests/data/Makefile.am, tests/data/test1013,

2007-10-31 19:32  danf

	* tests/valgrind.pm: Detect curl source when valgrind provides an
	  absolute source file name

2007-10-31 11:58  giva

	* lib/Makefile.Watcom: Add support for LDAP urls. Allthough the
	  OpenWatcom headers <winlap.h> and <winber.h> defines wrong
	  calling convention.

2007-10-31 11:20  giva

	* lib/Makefile.Watcom: Added optional use of zlib (USE_ZLIB=1).
	  Use a response-file for the C-compiler.

2007-10-31 10:21  bagder

	* RELEASE-NOTES: contributor re-count (we'll break the 600 limit
	  very very soon now) and I made all the numericals at the top
	  phrased "shorter" and I cut out the "number of releases since the
	  very beginning" since that's just the number curl releases + 26
	  and not a very interesting number anyway.

2007-10-31 00:00  danf

	* CHANGES, lib/file.c, lib/file.h, lib/url.c: Fixed an OOM problem
	  with file: URLs Moved Curl_file_connect into the protocol handler
	  struct.

2007-10-30 23:48  bagder

	* docs/THANKS: added new people from the 7.17.1 announcement

2007-10-29 23:57  danf

	* CHANGES, tests/data/Makefile.am, tests/data/test546: Added test

	  failed one using the multi interface

2007-10-29 23:13  bagder

	* RELEASE-NOTES: curl-config --features and --protocols show the
	  correct output when built with NSS

2007-10-29 23:13  bagder

	* CHANGES, configure.ac, curl-config.in: Based on one of those bug
	  reports that are intercepted by a distro's bug tracker
	  (https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=316191), I now made
	  curl-config --features and --protocols show the correct output

	* tests/: FILEFORMAT, data/test2000, data/test2001, data/test2002,

2007-10-27 03:02  danf

	* tests/ftpserver.pl: Made the magic testnumber > 10000 support
	  actually work

2007-10-26 22:19  danf

	  are supported, not just the first.

2007-10-26 09:46  bagder

	* docs/curl-config.1: mention --static-libs as added in 7.17.1

2007-10-26 03:12  yangtse

	* lib/url.c: typecast to prevent compiler warning

2007-10-26 02:36  yangtse

	  docs/curl-config.1: Added the --static-libs option to curl-config

2007-10-25 23:49  danf

	* tests/data/test518: Disable valgrind for this test to avoid the
	  rlimit = soft rlimit problem found by Michal Marek.

2007-10-25 23:14  bagder

	* RELEASE-NOTES: oops

2007-10-25 23:08  bagder

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES, lib/nss.c: Made libcurl built with NSS
	  possible to ignore the peer verification.  Previously it would
	  fail if the ca bundle wasn't present, even if the code ignored
	  the verification results.

2007-10-25 23:04  danf

	* tests/data/: Makefile.am, test1004, test2004: Added test case
	  2004.  Disable valgrind in test case 1004 due to a libtool bug.

2007-10-25 22:54  bagder

	* lib/nss.c: prevent compiler warnings about shadowing and one case
	  of unused variable

2007-10-25 21:40  patrickm

	* CHANGES, tests/data/Makefile.am, tests/data/test35,
	  tests/data/test544, tests/data/test545,
	  tests/libtest/Makefile.am, tests/libtest/lib544.c,
	  tests/server/sws.c: Allow test server to handle binary POSTs.
	  Tests 35, 544 545 added: binary data POSTs.

2007-10-25 21:39  danf

	* tests/runtests.pl: When valgrind is disabled in the test file,
	  don't run it at all (as opposed to running it and ignoring its
	  output).

2007-10-25 20:07  yangtse

	* tests/runtests.pl: Don't show valgrind log files of other tests

2007-10-25 16:30  bagder

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES, tests/runtests.pl: Michal Marek fixed the
	  test script to be able to use valgrind even when the lib is built
	  shared with libtool.

2007-10-25 11:41  bagder

	* lib/url.c: Don't assume there's a sessionhandle around when a
	  connection is disconnected, so do the data->reqdata.current_conn
	  assignment when we know there is an easy handle existing! Fixes
	  the valgrind report on test 509.

2007-10-25 11:34  bagder

	* lib/tftp.c: fix the check

2007-10-25 09:47  bagder

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES, lib/tftp.c, tests/data/DISABLED: Fixed a
	  TFTP memory leak. Enabled test 2003 to verify this.

2007-10-25 00:48  danf

	* CHANGES, tests/data/DISABLED, tests/data/Makefile.am,
	  tests/data/test2002, tests/data/test2003, tests/server/tftpd.c:
	  Fixed the test TFTP server to support the >10000 test number
	  notation Added test cases 2002 and 2003 (the latter disabled for
	  now)

2007-10-24 23:27  bagder

	* tests/data/DISABLED: enable 2000 and 2001

2007-10-24 23:14  bagder

	* lib/ftp.c: Curl_ftp_disconnect() no longer relies on anything in
	  the reqdata struct. That was even mentioned to be bad in a
	  comment! Should make test 2000 and 2001 work fine.

	  Also, freedirs() now take a ftp_conn struct pointer which saves
	  some extra unnecessary variable assignments.

2007-10-24 23:09  bagder

	* lib/urldata.h: added clarifying comment

2007-10-24 21:40  danf

	* CHANGES, tests/README, tests/data/DISABLED,
	  tests/data/Makefile.am, tests/data/test2000, tests/data/test2001,
	  tests/data/test51: Added test cases 2000 and 2001 which test
	  multiple protocols using the same easy handle Fixed the
	  filecheck: make target to work outside the source tree

2007-10-24 21:39  danf

	* tests/ftpserver.pl: Fixed the test FTP server to support the
	  >10000 test number notation

2007-10-24 18:40  yangtse

	* acinclude.m4: Missing double quotes

2007-10-24 16:39  yangtse

	* ares/config-win32.h, ares/setup.h, ares/setup_once.h,
	  lib/config-win32.h, lib/config-win32ce.h, lib/setup_once.h,
	  src/config-win32.h: Windows build targets have socklen_t
	  definition in ws2tcpip.h but some versions of ws2tcpip.h do not
	  have the definition. It seems that when the socklen_t definition
	  is missing from ws2tcpip.h the definition for INET_ADDRSTRLEN is
	  also missing, and that when one definition is present the other
	  one also is available.

2007-10-24 15:03  patrickm

	* tests/server/tftpd.c: Close log/server.input ASAP to avoid
	  lengthy file lock on cygwin

2007-10-24 11:28  bagder

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES, maketgz, src/Makefile.vc6: Vladimir
	  Lazarenko pointed out that we should do some 'mt' magic when
	  building with VC8 to get the "manifest" embedded to make fine
	  stand-alone binaries. The maketgz and the src/Makefile.vc6 files
	  were adjusted accordingly.

2007-10-23 23:00  bagder

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES, TODO-RELEASE, lib/url.c: Bug report
	  #1812190 (http://curl.haxx.se/bug/view.cgi?id=1812190) points out
	  that libcurl tried to re-use connections a bit too much when
	  using non-SSL protocols tunneled over a HTTP proxy.

2007-10-23 17:16  yangtse

	* lib/file.c: File is not a protocol that can deal with
	  "persistancy"

2007-10-23 17:10  yangtse

	* tests/libtest/lib508.c: Read callback should return 0 when no
	  more data left

2007-10-23 12:14  yangtse

	* lib/http.c: Fix compiler warning: subscript has type `char'

2007-10-23 01:31  gknauf

	* ares/ares_init.c: removed dependency on gettimeofday() since we
	  use only 1 sec resolution here.

2007-10-22 17:07  bagder

	* TODO-RELEASE: removed 105, it is now assumed to be fixed!

	  105 - "invalid free after an http redirect to ftp"

2007-10-22 17:05  bagder

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES, lib/file.c, lib/ftp.c, lib/http.c,
	  lib/ssh.c, lib/url.c, lib/url.h, lib/urldata.h: Michal Marek
	  forwarded the bug report
	  https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=332917 about a HTTP
	  redirect to FTP that caused memory havoc. His work together with
	  my efforts created two fixes:

	  #1 - FTP::file was moved to struct ftp_conn, because is has to be
	  dealt with	  at connection cleanup, at which time the struct
	  HandleData could be	   used by another connection.	     Also,
	  the unused char *urlpath member is removed from struct FTP.

	  #2 - provide a Curl_reset_reqproto() function that frees
	  data->reqdata.proto.* on connection setup if needed (that is if
	  the	   SessionHandle was used by a different connection).

2007-10-22 16:48  bagder

	* TODO-RELEASE: Removed 93 and 100, there's no work on these and
	  they're not critical in any way:

	  93 - Digest for IIS fix (subject for removal) 100 - icc
	  segmentation faults (subject for removal)

2007-10-22 12:23  bagder

	* TODO-RELEASE: #103 is fixed

2007-10-22 11:28  bagder

	* RELEASE-NOTES: mention Patrick Monnerat's recent work on the
	  postfields problems

2007-10-22 11:25  bagder

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES, lib/url.c: Bug report #1815530
	  (http://curl.haxx.se/bug/view.cgi?id=1815530) points out that
	  specifying a proxy with a trailing slash didn't work (unless it
	  also contained a port number).

	* maketgz: Mohun Biswas sent a patch to fix generated MSVC8
	  makefiles.

2007-10-20 17:47  yangtse

	  warnings, when assigning a NULL pointer to a function pointer
	  var.

2007-10-20 17:11  yangtse

	* ares/ares_init.c, lib/hostares.c, lib/url.c: Fix compiler
	  warning: conversion from "int" to "unsigned short" may lose
	  significant bits

2007-10-19 18:15  yangtse

	* acinclude.m4: Add custom check for WINLDAP libraries.

	  In CURL_CHECK_LIBS_WINLDAP and CURL_CHECK_LIBS_LDAP, check first
	  with no additional library even when the optional list of
	  libraries has been given.

	  lib/setup_once.h, lib/ssh.c, lib/telnet.c, lib/tftp.c, lib/url.c,
	  tests/libtest/lib509.c: We use this ZERO_NULL to avoid picky
	  compiler warnings, when assigning a NULL pointer to a function
	  pointer var.

2007-10-17 15:08  yangtse

	* acinclude.m4: Default check for more libraries in
	  CURL_CHECK_LIBS_LDAP, and allow parameter specification of
	  libraries to check.

2007-10-17 02:44  yangtse

	* lib/connect.c: Fix compiler warning: signed and unsigned type in

2007-10-16 23:27  sesse

	* ares/ares_search.c: Fix a bug where fallback from AF_INET6 to
	  AF_INET would not work properly together with relative search; if
	  you had a search path of .a.com and .b.com, and foo.a.com would
	  return ARES_ENODATA and foo.b.com would return ARES_ENOTFOUND,
	  the lookup would not properly retry with AF_INET as it forgot the
	  first ARES_ENODATA.

2007-10-16 20:09  danf

	* lib/url.c: Fixed compiler warning re: unused variable `bigsize'

2007-10-16 01:58  yangtse

2007-10-14 04:37  yangtse

	* acinclude.m4, configure.ac: Add custom checks for lber, ldap,
	  ldapssl and ldap_ssl header files

2007-10-13 22:49  bagder

	* docs/curl.1: Chris Leighton:

	  My understanding is that we use "number" for discrete variables
	  and "amount" for continuous variables.

	  So you can say "The amount of flour required depends on..." or,
	  "Last night I consumed a large amount of beer!".

	  And, "That tank contains a large number of fish" or, "Over the
	  week I consumed a number of cases of beer."

	  I think that features are discrete, so the man page would read
	  "...the number of features will make your head spin!".

2007-10-13 16:23  yangtse

	* acinclude.m4, configure.ac: Add check for winldap and winber
	  header files

2007-10-12 22:53  bagder

	* lib/url.c: another Curl_handler fix, the #ifdefs got a bit mixed

2007-10-09 16:53  bagder

	* docs/libcurl/curl_easy_setopt.3: Add a paragraph about
	  CURLOPT_CUSTOMREQUEST not actually changing libcurl's behavior,
	  it only changes the actual request method keyword and this is not
	  always what the user/app wants.

2007-10-09 10:42  bagder

	* CHANGES, docs/curl.1: Michal Marek removed the no longer existing
	  return codes from the curl.1 man page.

2007-10-08 16:39  giva

	* CHANGES, TODO-RELEASE, docs/KNOWN_BUGS, lib/http.c: Known bug
	  #47, which confused libcurl if doing NTLM auth over a proxy with
	  a response that was larger than 16KB is now improved slightly so
	  that now the restriction at 16KB is for the headers only and it
	  should be a rare situation where the response-headers exceed
	  16KB. Thus, I consider #47 fixed and the header limitation is now
	  known as known bug #48.

2007-10-06 19:20  giva

	* include/curl/curl.h: <ws2tcpip.h> needed for 'socklen_t' typedef.

2007-10-05 16:37  bagder

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES, docs/libcurl/curl_easy_setopt.3,
	  lib/url.c: Michael Wallner made the CULROPT_COOKIELIST option
	  support a new magic string: "FLUSH". Using that will cause
	  libcurl to flush its cookies to the CURLOPT_COOKIEJAR file.

2007-10-05 00:05  bagder

2007-10-04 12:01  bagder

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES, lib/connect.c, lib/tftp.c, lib/urldata.h,
	  tests/data/DISABLED, tests/data/Makefile.am, tests/data/test1009:
	  Kim Rinnewitz reported that --local-port didn't work with TFTP
	  transfers.  This happened because the tftp code always
	  uncondionally did a bind() without caring if one already had been
	  done and then it failed. I wrote a test case (1009) to verify
	  this, but it is a bit error-prone since it will have to pick a
	  fixed local port number and since the tests are run on so many
	  different hosts in different situations I add it in disabled
	  state.

2007-10-04 10:12  sesse

2007-10-03 10:45  bagder

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES, include/curl/curl.h, lib/connect.c,
	  lib/url.c, lib/urldata.h: Alexey Pesternikov introduced
	  CURLOPT_OPENSOCKETFUNCTION and CURLOPT_OPENSOCKETDATA to set a
	  callback that allows an application to replace the socket() call
	  used by libcurl. It basically allows the app to change address,
	  protocol or whatever of the socket. (I also did some whitespace
	  indent/cleanups in lib/url.c which kind of hides some of these
	  changes, sorry for mixing those in.)

	  Johnny Luong, libcurl now offers CURLOPT_SSH_HOST_PUBLIC_KEY_MD5
	  and the curl tool --hostpubmd5. They both make the SCP or SFTP
	  connection verify the remote host's md5 checksum of the public
	  key before doing a connect, to reduce the risk of a

	  ares_init.c, ares_private.h, ares_process.c, ares_query.c,

	  of timeouts was O(n^2) in the number of outstanding queries, and
	  processing a DNS response packet was O(n) in the number of
	  outstanding queries. To speed things up in Google, we added a few
	  circular, doubly-linked lists of queries that are hash-bucketed
	  based on the attributes we care about, so most important
	  operations are now O(1).

	  It might be that the number of buckets are higher than most
	  people would need, but on a quick calculation it should only be
	  100kB or so even on a 64-bit system, so I've let it stay as-is.

	  tests/data/Makefile.am, tests/data/test1011, tests/data/test1012:
	  Philip Langdale provided the new CURLOPT_POST301 option for
	  curl_easy_setopt() that alters how libcurl functions when
	  following redirects. It makes libcurl obey the RFC2616 when a 301
	  response is received after a non-GET request is made. Default
	  libcurl behaviour is to change method to GET in the subsequent
	  request (like it does for response code 302 - because that's what
	  many/most browsers do), but with this CURLOPT_POST301 option
	  enabled it will do what the spec says and do the next request
	  using the same method again. I.e keep POST after 301.

	  The curl tool got this option as --post301

	  Test case 1011 and 1012 were added to verify.

2007-09-26 14:00  bagder

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES, lib/ftp.c, lib/urldata.h,

	  libcurl FTP request with CURLOPT_NOBODY enabled but not
	  CURLOPT_HEADER, libcurl wouldn't do TYPE before it does SIZE
	  which makes it less useful. I walked over the code and made it do
	  this properly, and added test case 542 to verify it.

	  Correctly clear sockets from the fd_set on in several functions
	  (write_tcp_data, read_tcp_data, read_udp_packets) so that if it
	  fails and the socket is closed the following code doesn't try to
	  use the file descriptor.

2007-09-22 23:04  bagder

	* ares/: CHANGES, ares_process.c: Steinar H. Gunderson modified
	  c-ares to now also do to DNS retries even when TCP is used since

2007-09-22 22:45  bagder

	* ares/: CHANGES, ares_init.c: Brad House provided a fix for
	  ares_save_options(): Apparently I overlooked something with the
	  ares_save_options() where it would try to do a malloc(0) when no
	  options of that type needed to be saved.  On most platforms, this
	  was fine because malloc(0) doesn't actually return NULL, but on
	  AIX it does, so ares_save_options would return ARES_ENOMEM.

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES, configure.ac, docs/curl.1, lib/nss.c,
	  lib/urldata.h: Rob Crittenden provided an NSS update with the
	  following highlights:

	  o It looks for the NSS database first in the environment variable
	  SSL_DIR,   then in /etc/pki/nssdb, then it initializes with no
	  database if neither of   those exist.

	  o If the NSS PKCS#11 libnspsem.so driver is available then PEM
	  files may be	 loaded, including the ca-bundle. If it is not
	  available then only	certificates already in the NSS database
	  are used.

	  o Tries to detect whether a file or nickname is being passed in
	  so the right	 thing is done

	  o Added a bit of code to make the output more like the OpenSSL
	  module,   including displaying the certificate information when
	  connecting in   verbose mode

	  o Improved handling of certificate errors (expired, untrusted,
	  etc)

	  The libnsspem.so PKCS#11 module is currently only available in
	  Fedora 8/rawhide. Work will be done soon to upstream it. The NSS
	  module will work with or without it, all that changes is the
	  source of the certificates and keys.

	  to get the files id_dsa.pub and id_dsa from the current directory

	  themselves.

2007-09-17 23:42  danf

	* tests/: FILEFORMAT, runtests.pl: Added %CLIENTIP and %CLIENT6IP

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES, tests/data/Makefile.am,

	  tests/libtest/lib541.c: Daniel S (12 September 2007) - Bug report
	  #1792649 (http://curl.haxx.se/bug/view.cgi?id=1792649) pointed
	  out a problem with doing an empty upload over FTP on a re-used
	  connection.	 I added test case 541 to reproduce it and to
	  verify the fix.

	  - I noticed while writing test 541 that the FTP code wrongly did
	  a CWD on the	 second transfer as it didn't store and remember
	  the "" path from the	 previous transfer so it would instead CWD
	  to the entry path as stored. This   worked, but did a superfluous
	  command. Thus, test case 541 now also verifies   this fix.

	  data...

2007-09-05 19:22  danf

	  the curl_ftpssl enum to curl_usessl and its enumerated constants,
	  creating macros for backward compatibility.

2007-08-31 19:56  danf

	* CHANGES, lib/strerror.c: Made some of the error strings returned

	* lib/multi.c: Fixed an invalid returned error code added in my

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES, lib/ssh.c, tests/data/Makefile.am,

	  by multiple protocols. Several unused error codes were removed.
	  In all cases, macros were added to preserve source (and binary)
	  compatibility with the old names.  These macros are subject to
	  removal at a future date, but probably not before 2009.  An

	  instead use the proper low-level ftp_readresp() function.
	  Hopefully adressing bug #1779054.

2007-08-29 07:36  danf

	* lib/: cookie.c, cookie.h, file.c, hash.c, tftp.c, url.c: Added

2007-08-25 14:08  gknauf

	* lib/Makefile.m32, src/Makefile.m32: only link with -lwldap32 if

2007-08-24 19:08  gknauf

	* lib/Makefile.m32, lib/config-win32.h, src/Makefile.m32: added

	* packages/OS400/: make-include.sh, makefile.sh: Adding DOCS file

	  tests/data/test1006: Bug report #1779054
	  (http://curl.haxx.se/bug/view.cgi?id=1779054) pointed out that
	  libcurl didn't deal with large responses from server commands,
	  when the single response was consisting of multiple lines but of
	  a total size of 16KB or more. Dan Fandrich improved the ftp test
	  script and provided test case 1006 to repeat the problem, and I
	  fixed the code to make sure this new test case runs fine.

2007-08-24 11:06  patrickm

	* lib/: gtls.c, nss.c, ssluse.c, version.c: Remove leading space in
	  curl_version_info ss_version field.

2007-08-24 01:25  danf

	* tests/data/: Makefile.am, test1005: Added test case 1005 to test
	  excessively-long replies spread out over multiple lines (similar
	  to test case 1003).

2007-08-24 01:24  danf

	* tests/: FILEFORMAT, ftpserver.pl: Allow ftp server alternate
	  replies to contain backslash-escaped control characters.

2007-08-23 20:46  patrickm

	* packages/OS400/os400sys.c: Make ldap.h, gssapi.h and qsossl.h
	  inclusions conditional.

2007-08-23 20:45  danf

	* tests/ftpserver.pl: Need even more time to wait for an accept.

2007-08-23 19:35  danf

	* tests/data/: Makefile.am, test1004, test16: Added test1004 to
	  validate a previous fix for a memory leak when an empty proxy
	  server is selected.

2007-08-23 19:26  danf

	* docs/INSTALL: Mention OS/400 and TPF

2007-08-23 17:00  bagder

	* RELEASE-NOTES: ported to OS/400

2007-08-23 16:58  bagder

	* lib/Makefile.am: added the two new os400 files

2007-08-23 16:46  bagder

	* packages/Makefile.am: Add the files in the OS400 dir to the dist.
	  I didn't add it as a new subdir just because if I do that
	  automake does funny things automatically with the makefile.sh
	  file in that directory and thus doing it this way was a quick
	  work-around that annoyance!

2007-08-23 16:33  bagder

	* docs/curl.1: --libcurl does not support -F

2007-08-23 02:10  gknauf

	* lib/ldap.c: added support for CA cert verification; default now
	  to verify cert unless data->set.ssl.verifypeer is 0.

2007-08-23 00:48  bagder

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES, lib/file.c: Bug report #1779751
	  (http://curl.haxx.se/bug/view.cgi?id=1779751) pointed out that
	  doing first a file:// upload and then an FTP upload crashed
	  libcurl or at best caused furious valgrind complaints. Fixed now
	  by making sure we free and clear the file-specific struct
	  properly when done with it.

2007-08-22 20:05  giva

2007-08-22 16:18  bagder

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES, lib/ftp.c, tests/data/Makefile.am,
	  tests/data/test1003: Bug report #1779054
	  (http://curl.haxx.se/bug/view.cgi?id=1779054) pointed out that
	  libcurl didn't deal with very long (>16K) FTP server response
	  lines properly. Starting now, libcurl will chop them off (thus
	  the client app will not get the full line) but survive and deal
	  with them fine otherwise. Test case 1003 was added to verify
	  this.

2007-08-22 16:09  bagder

	* tests/server/sockfilt.c: added a size > buffer size check to make
	  it easier to track this in the future

2007-08-22 15:57  bagder

	* tests/server/sockfilt.c: Upped the buffer size to 17000+ bytes to
	  prepare for the upcoming test 1003 that verfies ridiculously long
	  server response lines. Also changed sprintf to snprintf in a few
	  places.

2007-08-22 13:28  bagder

	* docs/libcurl/curl_easy_cleanup.3: 1) the talk about strings used
	  by libcurl doesn't apply to libcurl >= 7.17.0 2) added nroff
	  header

2007-08-22 12:14  gknauf

	* lib/ldap.c: for now comment the tls_start section...

2007-08-21 05:04  gknauf

	* lib/Makefile.m32, src/Makefile.m32: sync libssh2 paths with
	  comments.

2007-08-21 04:42  gknauf

	* lib/Makefile.m32, src/Makefile.m32: added targets to create the
	  files missing in CVS which makes calling buildconf.bat obsolete;
	  removed obsolete wsock32 link lib.

2007-08-21 01:31  gknauf

	* src/Makefile.m32: fixed wrong CLAGS define.

2007-08-21 01:31  gknauf

	* lib/ldap.c: fixed warning with unused var; removed now obsolete
	  defines since we include now ldap headers which define these.

2007-08-20 23:54  bagder

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES, lib/ftp.c: Based on a patch by Christian
	  Vogt, the FTP code now sets the upcoming download transfer size
	  much earlier to be possible to get read with
	  CURLINFO_CONTENT_LENGTH_DOWNLOAD as soon as possible.

2007-08-20 21:33  gknauf

	* configure.ac: converted tabs to spaces.

2007-08-20 21:30  gknauf

	* configure.ac: removed trailing spaces.

2007-08-20 19:53  danf

	* tests/ftpserver.pl: Increase timeout for accept for improved
	  reliability on loaded servers.

2007-08-20 18:34  gknauf

	* lib/Makefile.netware, src/Makefile.netware: compile with ldaps by
	  default since it seems to work fine so far.

2007-08-20 18:30  gknauf

	* lib/ldap.c: fixed ldaps section for OpenLDAP. Still not working,
	  but at least it compiles now, and should serve as base to get it
	  finally working. Also seems that the ifdefs can be arranged some
	  better because the Solaris and Netscape/iPlanet/Mozilla LDAP SDKs
	  seem to be closer to the Novell section than the OpenLDAP one.

2007-08-20 18:21  gknauf

	* lib/Makefile.m32, src/Makefile.m32: added some comments about the
	  paths and build options; added define to build with ldaps
	  support; enabled build with the Novell LDAP SDK.

2007-08-20 17:51  gknauf

	* configure.ac: dont set CURL_LDAP_HYBRID for MingW32 configure
	  builds.

2007-08-20 14:50  gknauf

	* configure.ac, lib/Makefile.netware, lib/config-win32.h,
	  src/Makefile.netware: added define for ldap_ssl.h.

2007-08-20 01:23  gknauf

	* lib/Makefile.m32, src/Makefile.m32: ignore errors of the RM
	  command; seems that the del command fails on W2K when the file to
	  delete isnt found while on XP it only prints the warning but make
	  continues....

2007-08-19 02:26  gknauf

	* lib/Makefile.m32, src/Makefile.m32: added some comments in the
	  makefiles about build options.

2007-08-18 00:33  bagder

	* docs/examples/.cvsignore: ignore all the binaries and the .deps
	  and .libs

2007-08-18 00:31  bagder

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES, lib/ftp.c: - Robson Braga Araujo filed
	  bug report #1776232
	  (http://curl.haxx.se/bug/view.cgi?id=1776232) about libcurl
	  calling   Curl_client_write(), passing on a const string that the
	  caller may not   modify and yet it does (on some platforms).

2007-08-18 00:24  bagder

	* tests/data/test1000: remove stupid comment since there's no
	  content in this test case

2007-08-18 00:22  bagder

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES, lib/ftp.c, tests/data/Makefile.am,
	  tests/data/test1000: Robson Braga Araujo filed bug report
	  #1776235 (http://curl.haxx.se/bug/view.cgi?id=1776235) about ftp
	  requests with NOBODY on a directory would do a "SIZE (null)"
	  request. This is now fixed and test case 1000 was added to
	  verify.

2007-08-18 00:21  bagder

	* docs/TODO:  NEXT soname bump

	   * #undef CURL_FTP_HTTPSTYLE_HEAD in lib/ftp.c to remove the
	  HTTP-style headers
	     from being output in NOBODY requests over ftp

2007-08-18 00:17  bagder

	* tests/data/: test1001, test1002: some keywords for future
	  stats/coverage checks

2007-08-18 00:11  bagder

	* tests/data/: Makefile.am, test1001, test1002, test5320, test5322:
	  Moved the 5320 and 5322 into the 1000-series instead which is a
	  documented range. They are about FTP but the 100-199 range is
	  full.

2007-08-17 22:21  bagder

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES, lib/http.c, tests/data/Makefile.am,
	  tests/data/test5320, tests/data/test5322: Song Ma provided a
	  patch that cures a problem libcurl has when doing resume HTTP PUT
	  using Digest authentication. Test case 5320 and 5322 were also
	  added to verify the functionality.

2007-08-16 17:23  gknauf

	* lib/ldap.c: fixed warning about uninitialized.

2007-08-16 16:08  gknauf

	* lib/: ldap.c, url.c, version.c: added basic ldaps support; for
	  now its ifdef'd with HAVE_LDAP_SSL unless we know its fully
	  working, and available with all LDAP SDKs.  Win32 requires to
	  have the trusted CA in local keystore - I've not found yet a way
	  to disable the cert check.

2007-08-15 18:17  gknauf

	* lib/urldata.h: added define PORT_LDAPS.

2007-08-15 16:49  patrickm

	* lib/version.c: Fix a potential buffer overflow bug in
	  lib/version.c

2007-08-15 10:18  gknauf

	* lib/ldap.c: added ldap_msgfree() to fix memory leak.

2007-08-14 20:39  gknauf

	* lib/Makefile.m32, src/Makefile.m32: added a dependency for
	  libcares if build with ares support; other minor makefile tweaks.

2007-08-14 19:23  danf

	* docs/INSTALL: LDAP is no longer excluded on Minix.

2007-08-14 18:43  gknauf

	* docs/INSTALL: updated NetWare docu about recent LDAP changes.

2007-08-14 18:31  gknauf

	* lib/Makefile.netware, src/Makefile.netware: only include LDAP
	  headers if we build with LDAP support.

2007-08-14 16:48  gknauf

	* lib/Makefile.m32, src/Makefile.m32: added  -lwldap32 to link
	  libs.

2007-08-14 15:01  gknauf

	* lib/Makefile.netware, src/Makefile.netware: changed autoload
	  dependent LDAP NLM.

2007-08-14 14:02  gknauf

	* lib/Makefile.netware, src/Makefile.netware: trial to enable LDAP
	  support again with patched Novell headers.

2007-08-14 12:28  bagder

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES, lib/http_ntlm.c: Andrew Wansink provided
	  an NTLM bugfix: in the case the server sets the flag
	  NTLMFLAG_NEGOTIATE_UNICODE, we need to filter it off because
	  libcurl doesn't unicode encode the strings it packs into the NTLM
	  authenticate packet.

2007-08-14 12:11  bagder

	* docs/TODO: the curl_multi_handle_control() idea

2007-08-13 20:11  danf

	* tests/libtest/Makefile.am: Removed redundant dependency lines

2007-08-13 18:37  danf

	* lib/ldap.c: Removed unused variable.

2007-08-13 15:03  patrickm

	* lib/ldap.c: Simplify and rename internal structure to avoid
	  potential name clash with LDAP header file.

2007-08-13 00:25  bagder

	* lib/ldap.c: Fixed the LDAP_DEPRECATED #define as suggested by
	  Daniel Johnson, and indented some of the code to curl-style

2007-08-12 22:36  bagder

	* src/main.c: minor change in language for the --libcurl source
	  header

2007-08-12 02:48  gknauf

	* lib/Makefile.netware: disable LDAP since we can no longer compile
	  due to header incompatiblities.

2007-08-11 23:05  bagder

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES, lib/transfer.c: Allen Pulsifer provided a
	  patch that makes libcurl set the expected download size earlier
	  when doing HTTP downloads, so that applications and the progress
	  meter etc know get the info earlier in the flow than before.

2007-08-11 22:57  bagder

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES, acinclude.m4, configure.ac,
	  docs/examples/Makefile.example, hiper/Makefile,
	  lib/Makefile.Watcom, lib/Makefile.inc, lib/Makefile.netware,
	  lib/config-riscos.h, lib/config-tpf.h, lib/config-win32.h,
	  lib/config-win32ce.h, lib/curl_ldap.h, lib/ldap.c, lib/ldap.h,
	  lib/url.c, packages/vms/config-vms.h, src/Makefile.netware,
	  src/config-riscos.h: Patrick Monnerat modified the LDAP code and
	  approach in curl. Starting now, the configure script checks for
	  openldap and friends and we link with those libs just like we
	  link all other third party libraries, and we no longer dlopen()
	  those libraries. Our private header file lib/ldap.h was renamed
	  to lib/curl_ldap.h due to this. I set a tag in CVS
	  (curl-7_17_0-preldapfix) just before this commit, just in case.

2007-08-10 00:33  gknauf

	* lib/nwos.c: fixed warning with gcc 4.x (hopefully); dynamincally
	  imported UseAccurateCaseForPaths() for CLIB port to be
	  stonetime-compatible (NW 3.x).

2007-08-09 23:05  gknauf

	* lib/mprintf.c: fixed a warning which MingW gcc 4.2.1.

2007-08-09 05:28  danf

	* tests/data/test56: There's no need to ignore the User-Agent for
	  this test.

2007-08-08 22:09  gknauf

	* lib/: inet_ntop.c, nwos.c: moved ugly CLIB define to nwos.c.

2007-08-08 19:51  danf

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES, lib/content_encoding.c: Song Ma noted a
	  zlib memory leak in the illegal compressed header countermeasures
	  code path.

2007-08-08 19:07  gknauf

	* src/Makefile.m32: removed asm rules since we have no asm in the
	  sources, and this produced 2 warnings.

2007-08-08 18:59  gknauf

	* lib/config-win32.h, src/config-win32.h: blocked ssize_t define
	  for MingW32.

2007-08-08 12:37  patrickm

	* lib/: krb5.c, memdebug.c: Fix getsockname argument type Improve
	  "universal" alignment type in struct memdebug

2007-08-07 23:14  bagder

	* docs/libcurl/curl_easy_setopt.3: Usage of the
	  BCURLOPT_PROGRESSFUNCTION callback is not recommended when using
	  the multi interface, but having the comment in here caused more
	  questions than we fixed problems so I remove it now. It still
	  works fine.

2007-08-07 20:24  danf

	* lib/url.c: Fixed torture test for test 509

2007-08-07 19:40  gknauf

	* lib/Makefile.Watcom, lib/Makefile.m32, lib/config-win32.h,
	  src/Makefile.Watcom, src/config-win32.h: moved HAVE_LONGLONG from
	  makefiles to config-win32.h.

2007-08-07 15:01  bagder

	* docs/TODO: add URL to more "generated public config.h" details

2007-08-07 14:44  patrickm

	* include/curl/mprintf.h, lib/ssluse.c, lib/strtoofft.h: Some #if
	  --> #ifdef undef standard *printf before (re)defining them

2007-08-07 02:10  danf

	* tests/libtest/lib540.c, lib/url.c: Fixed some icc compiler
	  warnings.

2007-08-07 00:21  gknauf

	* docs/INSTALL: Peteris Krumins pointed out that MingW32 doesnt
	  provide a batch file to set the path to the bin folder.

2007-08-06 17:58  bagder

	* docs/THANKS: ontributors from the 7.16.4 release notes and a
	  removed duplicate

2007-08-06 17:54  bagder

	* docs/INSTALL: removed the rsaglue hint since it doesn't apply to
	  modern OpenSSL, and added some brief hints about gssapi and
	  libssh2

2007-08-06 16:56  bagder

	* docs/TODO: we now support GSS/Kerberos 5 for ftp file transfers!

2007-08-05 23:33  bagder

	* lib/formdata.c: Patrick Monnerat updated the _FORM_DEBUG-enabled
	  code, and I updated comments based on his comments/suggestions.

2007-08-05 01:35  gknauf

	* lib/Makefile.netware, src/Makefile.netware: changed to use
	  libssh2 0.16; fixed link order in case libssh2 is build with
	  zlib.

2007-08-04 22:58  bagder

	* RELEASE-NOTES: another mirror

2007-08-04 22:47  bagder

	* CHANGES, lib/escape.c, lib/strtoofft.c: Patrick Monnerat fixed
	  curl_easy_escape() and curlx_strtoll() to work on non-ASCII
	  systems.

2007-08-04 18:54  danf

	* lib/url.c: Fixed a couple of compiler warnings.

2007-08-04 00:46  danf

	* lib/url.c: Refactored CreateConnection() somewhat to reduce its
	  length by splitting it into a few new functions.  Fixed a few
	  leaks in out of memory conditions, including for test case 231.

2007-08-03 21:54  gknauf

	* src/Makefile.m32: fixed small fix issue I introduced with my
	  previous commit.

2007-08-03 16:30  gknauf

	* lib/Makefile.m32, src/Makefile.m32: some more makefile
	  fixes/changes.

2007-08-03 15:57  jehousley

	* lib/ssh.c: Start adding some expanded error conversion of libssh2
	  errors.

2007-08-03 15:46  jehousley

	* lib/: transfer.c, url.c: The previous commit to force the use of
	  libssh2-0.16 by removing LIBSSH2_APINO

2007-08-03 14:53  gknauf

	* lib/Makefile.m32, src/Makefile.m32: changed 'rm -f' to 'del /f'
	  so it works without GnuUtils as Peteris Krumins pointed out;
	  changed to use latest external libs.

2007-08-03 13:46  gknauf

	* docs/: INSTALL, README.win32: Peteris Krumins pointed out some
	  MingW32 related build issues.

2007-08-03 13:24  gknauf

	* Makefile.dist: Peteris Krumins pointed out that the standard
	  MingW32 build depends on zlib; removed that, and added another
	  option for zlib build, and renamed all other targets to reflect
	  zlib dependency.

2007-08-03 10:31  bagder

	* RELEASE-NOTES: SCP and SFTP support now requires libssh2 0.16 or
	  later

2007-08-03 10:25  bagder

	* lib/ssh.c: remove left-over partly support for libssh2 0.14

2007-08-03 10:14  bagder

	* lib/: ssh.c, ssh.h: The SSH code now only works with libssh2 0.16
	  or later. Thus we must not release the next curl until there is a
	  libssh2 0.16 released.

2007-08-02 22:10  bagder

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES, lib/url.c: Scott Cantor filed bug report
	  #1766320 (http://curl.haxx.se/bug/view.cgi?id=1766320) pointing
	  out that the libcurl code accessed two curl_easy_setopt() options
	  (CURLOPT_DNS_CACHE_TIMEOUT and CURLOPT_DNS_USE_GLOBAL_CACHE) as
	  ints even though they're documented to be passed in as longs, and
	  that makes a difference on 64 bit architectures.

2007-08-02 21:23  danf

	* lib/url.c: Fixed a compiler warning.

2007-08-02 16:42  bagder

	* lib/: connect.c, qssl.c: Patrick Monnerat's cleanup fix after my
	  alloc-strings commit

2007-08-02 16:09  bagder

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES, lib/url.c, tests/data/Makefile.am,
	  tests/data/test231: Dmitriy Sergeyev reported a regression:
	  resumed file:// transfers broke after 7.16.2. This is much due to
	  the different treatment file:// gets internally, but now I added
	  test 231 to make it less likely to happen again without us
	  noticing!

2007-08-02 15:26  bagder

	* docs/libcurl/curl_easy_setopt.3: clarify that setting POSTFIELDS
	  to NULL or "" is not enough to make a zero byte POST

2007-08-02 13:34  bagder

	* lib/http.c: argh, Greg Morse pointed out that the NTLM POST fix
	  only worked if VERBOSE was set, this should make it work for all
	  cases!

2007-08-01 23:20  bagder

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES, docs/libcurl/curl_easy_getinfo.3,
	  docs/libcurl/curl_easy_setopt.3, include/curl/curlver.h,
	  lib/connect.c, lib/easy.c, lib/ftp.c, lib/getinfo.c, lib/gtls.c,
	  lib/gtls.h, lib/http.c, lib/nss.c, lib/nssg.h, lib/ssh.c,
	  lib/sslgen.c, lib/ssluse.c, lib/transfer.c, lib/url.c, lib/url.h,
	  lib/urldata.h: Patrick Monnerat and I modified libcurl so that
	  now it *copies* all strings passed to it with curl_easy_setopt()!
	  Previously it has always just refered to the data, forcing the
	  user to keep the data around until libcurl is done with it. That
	  is now history and libcurl will instead clone the given strings
	  and keep private copies.

2007-08-01 14:58  bagder

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES, lib/http.c: Greg Morse reported a problem
	  with POSTing using ANYAUTH to a server requiring NTLM, and he
	  provided test code and a test server and we worked out a bug fix.
	  We failed to count sent body data at times, which then caused
	  internal confusions when libcurl tried to send the rest of the
	  data in order to maintain the same connection alive.

	  (and then I did some minor reformatting of code in lib/http.c)

2007-07-31 00:54  bagder

	* RELEASE-NOTES: AIX 4 and 5 get to use non-blocking sockets

2007-07-31 00:53  bagder

	* CHANGES, acinclude.m4: Peter O'Gorman pointed out (and fixed)
	  that the non-blocking check in configure made libcurl use
	  blocking sockets on AIX 4 and 5, while that wasn't the intention.

2007-07-31 00:01  bagder

	* docs/libcurl/curl_multi_socket.3: users should use the
	  CURLMOPT_TIMERFUNCTION rather than curl_multi_timeout when using
	  the socket API

2007-07-30 23:47  bagder

	* docs/libcurl/libcurl-multi.3: less blocking these days

2007-07-30 23:47  bagder

	* docs/libcurl/curl_multi_socket.3: updated based on suggestion
	  from Jeff Pohlmeyer

2007-07-30 23:41  bagder

	* lib/: http.c, qssl.h: Patrick Monnerat restored qssl successful
	  compilation and loading

2007-07-30 22:07  bagder

	  sections slightly

2007-07-29 14:54  bagder

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES, lib/ftp.c, lib/gtls.c, lib/nss.c,
	  lib/qssl.c, lib/sslgen.c, lib/sslgen.h, lib/ssluse.c,
	  lib/ssluse.h, lib/url.c, lib/urldata.h: Bug report #1759542
	  (http://curl.haxx.se/bug/view.cgi?id=1759542). A bad use of a
	  socket after it has been closed, when the FTP-SSL data connection
	  is taken down.

2007-07-27 10:33  bagder

	* lib/urldata.h: added missing part for the qsossl support

2007-07-26 23:56  bagder

	* ares/: Makefile.am, configure.ac, libcares.pc.in: added initial
	  pkg-config file (attempt)

2007-07-24 17:23  danf

	* lib/qssl.c: Removed unused variable.

2007-07-23 23:48  bagder

	* lib/url.c: #if that should be #ifdef

2007-07-23 23:46  bagder

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES, lib/Makefile.inc, lib/qssl.c, lib/qssl.h,
	  lib/sslgen.c: Implemented the parts of Patrick Monnerat's OS/400
	  patch that introduces support for the OS/400 Secure Sockets Layer
	  library

2007-07-23 20:51  danf

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES, lib/easy.c, lib/file.c, lib/ftp.c,
	  lib/http.c, lib/sendf.c, lib/transfer.c, lib/url.c,
	  lib/urldata.h, tests/libtest/lib506.c: Implemented only the parts
	  of Patrick Monnerat's OS/400 patch that renamed some few internal
	  identifiers to avoid conflicts, which could be useful on other
	  platforms.

2007-07-23 19:51  danf

	* tests/ftpserver.pl: Log the "<CMD> wasn't handled" error normally
	  since it is now expected to occur in a couple of tests.

2007-07-23 03:05  gknauf

	* src/Makefile.vc6: added 2 system libs necessary for linking
	  OpenSSL 0.9.8e statically.

2007-07-22 12:19  bagder

	* RELEASE-NOTES: fix mess added in my previous commit

2007-07-22 12:17  bagder

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES, lib/http_digest.c: HTTP Digest auth fix
	  on a re-used connection

2007-07-22 12:08  bagder

	* CHANGES, tests/data/Makefile.am, tests/data/test354: Added test
	  case 354 that makes a simple FTP retrieval without password,
	  which verifies the bug fix in #1757328.

2007-07-21 23:49  bagder

	* tests/data/test141: test and verify curl -I on a single FTP file
	  somewhat more than before

2007-07-21 23:48  bagder

	* tests/ftpserver.pl: To allow more flexibility in FTP test cases,
	  I've removed the enforced states from the test server code as
	  they served no real purpose. The test server is here to serve for
	  the test cases, not to attempt to function as a real server!

2007-07-21 23:47  bagder

	* RELEASE-NOTES: news

2007-07-21 04:08  danf

	* lib/: ftp.c, ssh.c: Make the pointers of a few static const
	  arrays const, too, for safety.

2007-07-20 23:50  gknauf

	* ares/Makefile.netware: added curl include for debug builds.

2007-07-20 19:29  danf

	* docs/: curl.1, libcurl/curl_easy_setopt.3: Document pwd as an
	  sftp quote command for curl(1), and show it as lower case for
	  consistency since sftp commands are case insensitive.

2007-07-20 18:01  gknauf

	* src/getpass.c: added lf to Win32  getpass_r() so that next output
	  appears in new line.

2007-07-20 17:33  bagder

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES: PWD for SFTP is fixed

2007-07-20 11:38  bagder

	* RELEASE-NOTES: the "libssh2 owns the memory don't free it" case

2007-07-20 11:35  bagder

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES, lib/ftp.c: Ralf S. Engelschall filed bug
	  report #1757328 (http://curl.haxx.se/bug/view.cgi?id=1757328) and
	  submitted a patch. It turns out we broke login to FTP servers
	  that don't require (nor understand) PASS after the USER command

2007-07-20 03:03  jehousley

	* lib/ssh.c: Fix a loop with PWD

2007-07-20 02:41  danf

	* lib/: ftp.c, gtls.c, nss.c, splay.c, ssh.c: Made some const
	  arrays static to avoid unnecessary stack usage.

2007-07-19 23:35  bagder

	* docs/BUGS: minor addition, re-count of the number of lines of
	  code

2007-07-19 17:08  bagder

	* CHANGES: libssh2 fix

2007-07-19 03:42  danf

	* tests/sshserver.pl: Revert the 512 change since newer versions of
	  OpenSSH don't support DSA keys that small.

2007-07-19 01:21  jehousley

	* docs/libcurl/curl_easy_setopt.3: SFTP also supports PWD

2007-07-19 00:23  danf

	* docs/libcurl/curl_easy_setopt.3: Added the list of sftp quote
	  commands.

2007-07-18 20:31  jehousley

	* lib/ssh.c: As has been pointed out, err_msg should not be freed
	  here.  The actual issue is in libssh2 and not freeing a dynamic
	  error message during cleanup.

2007-07-18 02:27  danf

	* tests/sshserver.pl: Use 512 bit keys to reduce the time taken to
	  generate them.  This shouldn't really reduce security since in
	  the common case of a daily automated build the keys are only used
	  for a single test run lasting a few minutes before being deleted.

2007-07-17 23:53  danf

	* CHANGES, tests/libtest/test613.pl: Fixed test cases 613 and 614
	  by improving the log postprocessor to handle a new directory
	  listing format that newer libssh2's can provide.  This is
	  probably NOT sufficient to handle all directory listing formats
	  that server's can provide and should be revisited.

2007-07-17 22:59  bagder

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES, lib/ftp.c: Jofell Gallardo posted a
	  libcurl log using FTP that exposed a bug which made a control
	  connection that was deemed "dead" to yet be re-used in a
	  following request. We must make sure the connection gets closed
	  on this situation.

2007-07-16 23:44  bagder

	* tests/data/test540: make it do all three requests on the same
	  connection

2007-07-16 23:22  danf

	* docs/examples/: anyauthput.c, cookie_interface.c, ftpget.c,
	  ftpgetresp.c, ftpupload.c, getinmemory.c, httpput.c,
	  post-callback.c, sepheaders.c: Fixed some more simple compile
	  warnings in the examples.

2007-07-16 23:08  bagder

	* docs/KNOWN_BUGS: 45. libcurl built to support ipv6 uses
	  getaddrinfo() to resolve host names.	  getaddrinfo() sorts the
	  response list which effectively kills how libcurl    deals with
	  round-robin DNS entries. All details:
	  http://curl.haxx.se/mail/lib-2007-07/0168.html    initial
	  suggested function to use for randomizing the response:
	  http://curl.haxx.se/mail/lib-2007-07/0178.html

2007-07-15 23:00  bagder

	* tests/: data/test540, libtest/lib540.c: convert test case 540 to
	  use a custom Host: header as well

2007-07-15 22:59  bagder

	* tests/libtest/: first.c, test.h: let's just export the whole argc
	  + argv pair globally so that each test tool can take advantage of
	  it however they see fit!

2007-07-15 15:00  gknauf

	* lib/Makefile.vc6, src/Makefile.vc6: make users use the latest
	  OpenSSL and Zlib libraries; added hint to compile with SSPI with
	  MSVC6 without PSDK.

2007-07-15 01:01  bagder

	* ares/ares_free_hostent.3: added another SEE ALSO

2007-07-15 00:39  bagder

	* tests/: data/Makefile.am, data/test540, libtest/Makefile.am,
	  libtest/lib540.c: Added test case 540 and lib540.c, the
	  'proxyauth.c' test app posted by Shmulik Regev on the libcurl
	  mailing list on 10 Jul 2007, converted to a test case.

2007-07-15 00:38  bagder

	* tests/libtest/: first.c, test.h: add support for arg3 as the
	  third argument...

2007-07-15 00:33  bagder

	* tests/runtests.pl: add some better logging when HTTP server start
	  fails, and make the failure really hard if the test server can't
	  be resolved (like for ::1 ipv6)

2007-07-14 17:59  gknauf

	* lib/: ssh.c, ssh.h, transfer.c, url.c: for now unless we do
	  better fixed LIBSSH2_APINO compares to use long constants.

2007-07-14 15:14  bagder

	* ares/ares_init.c: Brad House's fix to hish a win32 compiler
	  warning

2007-07-14 15:11  bagder

	* ares/CHANGES: added Vlad's entire description of his valgrind fix

2007-07-14 15:08  bagder

	* ares/: CHANGES, ares_init.c, ares_process.c, ares_query.c: Vlad
	  Dinulescu fixed two outstanding valgrind reports

2007-07-13 23:31  danf

	* docs/examples/Makefile.am: The examples don't need access to curl
	  internal source files.

2007-07-13 22:17  bagder

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES, lib/connect.c: Colin Hogben filed bug
	  report #1750274 (http://curl.haxx.se/bug/view.cgi?id=1750274) and
	  submitted a patch for the case where libcurl did a connect
	  attempt to a non-listening port and didn't provide a human
	  readable error string back.

2007-07-13 22:09  bagder

	* docs/INSTALL: Daniel Cater added the mentioning of
	  CURL_DISABLE_TFTP

2007-07-13 22:07  bagder

	* docs/libcurl/libcurl-errors.3: Daniel Cater: libcurl-errors needs
	  updating to reflect a couple of deprecated error codes

2007-07-13 22:04  bagder

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES, lib/connect.c, lib/ftp.c: Daniel Cater
	  made libcurl build with CURL_NO_OLDIES defined (which doesn't
	  define the symbols for backwards source compatibility)

2007-07-13 21:38  bagder

	* Makefile.dist: Daniel Cater made the vc8-generating line use
	  double-quotes to run fine on windows

2007-07-12 23:34  bagder

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES, lib/krb5.c: Made the krb5 code build with
	  Heimdal's GSSAPI lib

2007-07-12 23:11  danf

	* CHANGES, docs/examples/cacertinmem.c,
	  docs/examples/cookie_interface.c, docs/examples/curlx.c,
	  docs/examples/fileupload.c, docs/examples/fopen.c,
	  docs/examples/ftp3rdparty.c, docs/examples/ftpget.c,
	  docs/examples/ftpupload.c, docs/examples/ftpuploadresume.c,
	  docs/examples/ghiper.c, docs/examples/hiperfifo.c,
	  docs/examples/httpput.c, docs/examples/https.c,
	  docs/examples/multi-app.c, docs/examples/multi-post.c,
	  docs/examples/multithread.c, docs/examples/opensslthreadlock.c,
	  docs/examples/post-callback.c, docs/examples/postit2.c,
	  docs/examples/sepheaders.c, docs/examples/simplepost.c,
	  docs/examples/simplessl.c, docs/examples/synctime.c: Fixed some
	  compile warnings and errors and improved portability in the
	  examples.  Removed ftp3rdparty.c since libcurl doesn't support
	  3rd party FTP transfers any longer.

2007-07-12 22:55  bagder

	* docs/examples/anyauthput.c: make it compile fine

2007-07-12 22:54  bagder

	* docs/examples/Makefile.am: fix include path

2007-07-12 22:38  danf

	* Makefile.am, docs/examples/Makefile.am: Compile most of the
	  example apps in docs/examples when doing a 'make check'.

2007-07-12 22:15  bagder

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES, lib/url.c: Shmulik Regev found an (albeit
	  rare) case where the proxy CONNECT operation could in fact get
	  stuck in an endless loop.

2007-07-12 19:03  bagder

	* tests/server/sockfilt.c: start the retry delay at 10 ms, double
	  it for every failed attempt which makes it 10 seconds delay after
	  11 attempts

2007-07-12 12:54  gknauf

	* tests/server/sockfilt.c: the timeout was probably too short with
	  max = 1 sec, so lets test with 5 sec.

2007-07-12 12:44  gknauf

	* lib/Makefile.am: added nwos.c so that it gets distributed with
	  releases and tarballs.

2007-07-12 03:07  gknauf

	* tests/server/: sockfilt.c, util.c, util.h: added time loop to
	  sockfilt.c in order to wait for SO_REUSEADDR; added go_sleep() to
	  util.c.

2007-07-12 01:17  curlvms

	* packages/vms/: curlmsg.h, curlmsg.msg, curlmsg.sdl,
	  curlmsg_vms.h: Updated to match curl.h

2007-07-12 00:20  bagder

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES, lib/ssluse.c: Made CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYHOST
	  set to 1 acts as described in the documentation: fail to connect
	  if there is no Common Name field found in the remote cert.  We
	  should deprecate the support for this set to 1 anyway soon, since
	  the feature is pointless and most likely never really used by
	  anyone.

2007-07-11 23:47  gknauf

	* lib/: connect.c, hostip4.c, nwlib.c: removed now obsolete
	  NETDB_DEFINE_CONTEXT macro calls.

2007-07-11 23:38  gknauf

	* lib/Makefile.netware: updated makefile to compile nwos.c.

2007-07-11 23:34  gknauf

	* lib/: easy.c, nwos.c, setup.h: added NetWare-own file to provide
	  some init functions (for now only CLIB); added call to
	  netware_init() in curl_global_init() to make sure it gets called
	  before any library functions get used.

2007-07-11 21:21  danf

	* docs/libcurl/curl_easy_setopt.3: Added the first libcurl version
	  to which the SSH options were added.

2007-07-11 11:08  gknauf

	* lib/http_ntlm.c: added netdb.h for NetWare CLIB since
	  gethostname() is defined there.

2007-07-11 11:03  gknauf

	* lib/url.c: fixed endif comment.

2007-07-11 10:55  gknauf

	* lib/ssh.h: fixed endif comment.

2007-07-11 00:55  danf

	* tests/README: Added a code coverage section using gcc and gcov.

2007-07-11 00:45  bagder

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES, lib/http_chunks.c: Shmulik Regev: The
	  tiny patch below fixes a bug (that I introduced :) which happens
	  when negotiating authentication with a proxy (probably with web
	  servers as well) that uses chunked transfer encoding for the 407
	  error pages. In this case the ''ignorebody'' flag was ignored (no
	  pun intended).

2007-07-11 00:31  bagder

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES, lib/http.c: Giancarlo Formicuccia
	  reported and fixed a problem with a closed connection to a proxy
	  during CONNECT auth negotiation.

2007-07-11 00:27  danf

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES, tests/data/test31, tests/data/test46,
	  tests/data/test506, tests/data/test517, tests/data/test61: Force
	  the time zone to GMT in the cookie tests in case the user is
	  using one of the so-called 'right' time zones that take into
	  account leap seconds, which causes the tests to fail (as reported
	  by Daniel Black in bug report #1745964).

2007-07-11 00:26  jehousley

	* tests/data/test605: The previous commits changed the error code

2007-07-11 00:26  jehousley

	* lib/: ssh.c, ssh.h, transfer.c, url.c, urldata.h: * Finish moving
	  sftp:// into a state machine so it won't block in multi mode *
	  Move scp:// into a state machine so it won't block in multi mode
	  * When available use the full directory entry from the sftp://
	  server

2007-07-11 00:23  danf

	* src/main.c, tests/data/Makefile.am, tests/data/test289: Fixed a
	  curl memory leak reported by Song Ma with a modified version of
	  the patch he suggested.  Added his test case as test289 to
	  verify.

2007-07-11 00:07  bagder

	* RELEASE-NOTES, include/curl/curlver.h: start working on 7.16.5...

2007-07-10 23:36  bagder

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES, lib/gtls.c: 7.16.4 preps

2007-07-09 04:00  gknauf

	* lib/Makefile.netware: added better CodeWarrior detection (forgot
	  to add with previos version).

2007-07-09 01:19  gknauf

	* src/Makefile.netware: added better CodeWarrior detection; added
	  defines for setlocale().

2007-07-09 01:18  gknauf

	* lib/Makefile.netware: added better CodeWarrior detection; moved
	  autounload flag so that its used for both lib architectures.

2007-07-09 01:17  gknauf

	* ares/Makefile.netware: added better CodeWarrior detection.

2007-07-07 18:26  gknauf

	* ares/Makefile.netware, lib/Makefile.netware,
	  src/Makefile.netware: removed some obsolete include paths and
	  defines.

2007-07-07 00:14  bagder

	* lib/: krb5.c, security.c: Thomas J. Moore made it build with less
	  warnings

2007-07-06 23:56  bagder

	* RELEASE-NOTES: Gavrie Philipson's change, updated numbers

2007-07-06 22:14  bagder

	* docs/examples/ftpgetresp.c: add note about windows and dlls with
	  CURLOPT_WRITEDATA

2007-07-06 16:58  gknauf

	* src/getpass.c: fixed NetWare CLIB implementation of getpass_r()

2007-07-05 14:48  jehousley

	* CHANGES, lib/ssh.c: Gavrie Philipson provided a patch that will
	  use a more specific error message for an scp:// upload failure.
	  If libssh2 has his matching patch, then the error message return
	  by the server will be used instead of a more generic error.

2007-07-05 03:38  danf

	* tests/Makefile.am: Add -a when running torture tests now that
	  it's supported.

2007-07-05 00:54  jehousley

	* lib/ssh.c: Fix spelling error in error message

2007-07-04 19:20  gknauf

	* ares/configure.ac: add test for gettimeofday() so that
	  HAVE_GETTIMEOFDAY gets defined.

2007-07-04 15:45  gknauf

	* lib/Makefile.m32, src/Makefile.m32: enabled ares build.

2007-07-04 12:54  gknauf

	* ares/nameser.h: although the check for HAVE_STRUCT_TIMEVAL solved
	  the redefine it is incorrect; lets see if a check for
	  HAVE_GETTIMEOFDAY also works; if gettimeofday() is present then
	  we can assume we have the timezone struct too.

2007-07-04 11:01  gknauf

	* ares/configure.ac: added check for sys/param.h.

2007-07-03 20:18  gknauf

	* ares/nameser.h: trial to catch problem with Daniels cross-mingw
	  ares builds.

2007-07-03 18:21  gknauf

	* ares/ares.h: added NetWare CLIB-own header to solve gcc warnings.

2007-07-03 18:00  gknauf

	* ares/: Makefile.netware, ares.h, ares_getnameinfo.c, ares_init.c:
	  few minor changes to make ares compile for NetWare CLIB
	  architecture.

2007-07-03 02:50  gknauf

	* lib/Makefile.netware, src/Makefile.netware: fixed rule to build
	  libcares when needed.

2007-07-03 02:42  gknauf

	* ares/Makefile.netware: changed to build for CLIB / LIBC.

2007-07-03 02:12  gknauf

	* src/Makefile.netware: added libcares to static build if ares
	  enabled.

2007-07-03 00:04  bagder

	* docs/THANKS: contributors from the 7.16.3 release notes

2007-07-02 20:50  gknauf

	* ares/Makefile.netware: sync'd with lib makefile changes: use var
	  for awk; fixed RECV* / SEND* defines; debug var can be
	  overwritten; added better compiler path handling.

2007-07-02 20:42  gknauf

	* lib/Makefile.netware, src/Makefile.netware: some more makefile
	  tweaks and hacks to deal with both lib architectures.

2007-07-02 19:22  jehousley

	* docs/libcurl/curl_easy_setopt.3: Fix problem with the indenting
	  noticed by Pavel

2007-07-02 00:17  gknauf

	* src/Makefile.netware: ignore make error when trying to copy
	  curl.pdf which isnt in CVS.

2007-07-02 00:03  bagder

	* docs/libcurl/curl_easy_setopt.3: mention the old name

2007-07-02 00:01  bagder

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES, docs/FEATURES, docs/MANUAL, docs/curl.1,
	  docs/libcurl/curl_easy_setopt.3, include/curl/curl.h,
	  lib/Makefile.inc, lib/ftp.c, lib/hostip.c, lib/hostip4.c,
	  lib/hostip6.c, lib/krb4.h, lib/krb5.c, lib/security.c,
	  lib/sendf.c, lib/url.c, lib/urldata.h, src/main.c: Thomas J.
	  Moore provided a patch that introduces Kerberos5 support in
	  libcurl. This also makes the options change name to --krb (from
	  --krb4) and CURLOPT_KRBLEVEL (from CURLOPT_KRB4LEVEL) but the old
	  names are still

2007-07-01 23:28  bagder

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES, lib/ftp.c: Song Ma helped me verify and
	  extend a fix for doing FTP over a SOCKS4/5 proxy

2007-07-01 23:06  gknauf

	* lib/Makefile.netware, src/Makefile.netware: changed RECV_* /
	  SEND_* defines to correctly reflect NetWare APIs; some more minor
	  Makefile tidyups.

2007-07-01 18:55  gknauf

	* lib/Makefile.netware, src/Makefile.netware: disabled 64bit type
	  for CLIB build which removes compiler runtime dependency.

2007-07-01 14:09  gknauf

	* docs/INSTALL: updated NetWare docu.

2007-07-01 03:33  gknauf

	* lib/Makefile.netware, src/Makefile.netware: added lib
	  architecture to NLM description.

2007-07-01 01:53  gknauf

	* lib/Makefile.netware, src/Makefile.netware: added
	  HAVE_SYS_IOCTL_H define; added gcc runtime.

2007-07-01 01:45  gknauf

	* lib/setup.h, lib/timeval.c, src/curlutil.c, src/setup.h: moved
	  includes to setup.h so that the project headers also pick them up
	  (eleminate gcc warning).

2007-06-30 23:20  gknauf

	* lib/Makefile.netware, src/Makefile.netware: fixed path to
	  Metrowerks tools and runtime since they changed between compiler
	  versions.

2007-06-30 22:16  gknauf

	* include/curl/curl.h: minor patches to enable building for NetWare
	  CLIB.  sent by Dmitry Mityugov.

2007-06-30 22:08  gknauf

	* lib/connect.c, lib/hostip.h, lib/hostip4.c, lib/inet_ntop.c,
	  lib/timeval.c, src/curlutil.c, src/getpass.c, src/main.c: minor
	  patches to enable building for NetWare CLIB.	sent by Dmitry
	  Mityugov.

2007-06-30 22:02  gknauf

	* lib/Makefile.netware, lib/nwlib.c, src/Makefile.netware: enabled
	  building for NetWare CLIB architecture.

2007-06-29 00:31  gknauf

	* tests/testcurl.pl: revert previous patch since it turned out that
	  older cp dont know this switch, argh!

2007-06-28 13:11  jehousley

	* lib/file.c, lib/memdebug.c, lib/memdebug.h, tests/memanalyze.pl:
	  Using fdopen() is a more correct way to implement the
	  CURLOPT_NEW_FILE_PREMS file.c, but the debug interface was
	  missing.  This adds the routines needed to make the memory
	  debuging work for fdopen().

2007-06-28 12:47  bagder

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES: reality sync

2007-06-28 03:20  gknauf

	* tests/testcurl.pl: fixed nasty cp warnings about not beeing able
	  to preserve ownership.

2007-06-27 23:35  bagder

	* docs/examples/10-at-a-time.c: James Bursa's improvement

2007-06-27 23:29  bagder

	* docs/examples/10-at-a-time.c: fix little flaw that could make the
	  transfer loop end prematurely

2007-06-27 22:15  jehousley

	* docs/libcurl/curl_easy_setopt.3, include/curl/curl.h, lib/easy.c,
	  lib/file.c, lib/ssh.c, lib/url.c, lib/urldata.h: Add two new
	  options for the SFTP/SCP/FILE protocols: CURLOPT_NEW_FILE_PERMS
	  and CURLOPT_NEW_DIRECTORY_PERMS.  These control the premissions
	  for files and directories created on the remote server.
	  CURLOPT_NEW_FILE_PERMS defaults to 0644 and
	  CURLOPT_NEW_DIRECTORY_PERMS defaults to 0755

2007-06-27 12:14  gknauf

	* lib/ssh.c: removed trailing spaces.

2007-06-27 12:12  gknauf

	* lib/ssh.c: fixed wrong var name

2007-06-26 23:53  bagder

	* docs/FAQ: add an FTP rename example to 3.7

2007-06-26 23:09  bagder

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES, lib/hash.c, lib/hash.h, lib/hostip.c,
	  lib/multi.c: Robert Iakobashvili re-arranged the internal hash
	  code to work with a custom hash function for different hashes,
	  and also expanded the default size for the socket hash table used
	  in multi handles to greatly enhance speed when very many
	  connections are added and the socket API is used.

2007-06-26 22:23  jehousley

	* lib/ssh.c: The results for a list only directory should be sent
	  to the callback

2007-06-26 21:12  jehousley

	* lib/ssh.c: ftp_list_only mode should list all file types, not
	  just directories.

2007-06-25 16:17  bagder

	* lib/transfer.c: gah, adding missing braces, removed silly debug
	  output, added new debug output

2007-06-25 15:58  bagder

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES, lib/transfer.c, tests/data/test282:
	  Adjusted how libcurl treats HTTP 1.1 responses without
	  content-lenth or chunked encoding (that also lacks "Connection:
	  close"). It now simply assumes that the connection WILL be closed
	  to signal the end, as that is how RFC2616 section 4.4 point #5
	  says we should behave.

2007-06-25 15:52  bagder

	* include/curl/curlver.h: fix the version string as well

2007-06-25 11:34  bagder

	* RELEASE-NOTES, include/curl/curlver.h: start working towards
	  7.16.4

2007-06-25 11:18  bagder

	* CHANGES: 7.16.3

2007-06-24 21:32  bagder

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES, lib/ftp.c: As reported by "Tro" in
	  http://curl.haxx.se/mail/lib-2007-06/0161.html and
	  http://curl.haxx.se/mail/lib-2007-06/0238.html, libcurl didn't
	  properly do no-body requests on FTP files on re-used connections
	  properly, or at least it didn't provide the info back in the
	  header callback properly in the subsequent requests.

2007-06-22 23:10  gknauf

	* Makefile.dist: added netware install target

2007-06-22 23:10  gknauf

	* lib/Makefile.netware, src/Makefile.netware: made debug flag
	  settable from outside; add allways debug stuff when DB != NDEBUG

2007-06-22 22:24  bagder

	* lib/transfer.c: remove annoying debug output

2007-06-21 16:23  bagder

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES, lib/url.c, tests/data/test506: Gerrit
	  Bruchhuser pointed out a warning that the Intel(R) Thread
	  Checker tool reports and it was indeed a legitimate one and it is
	  one fixed. It was a use of a share without doing the proper
	  locking first.

2007-06-20 23:57  bagder

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES, src/main.c: Adam Piggott filed bug report
	  #1740263 (http://curl.haxx.se/bug/view.cgi?id=1740263). Adam
	  discovered that when getting a large amount of URLs with curl,
	  they were fetched slower and slower... which turned out to be
	  because the --libcurl data collecting which wrongly always was
	  enabled, but no longer is...

2007-06-20 13:30  jehousley

	* lib/ssh.c: If the creation of rsa and rsa_pub fail due to memory,
	  don't try other authentication methods.  Terminate with a memory
	  error.

2007-06-19 15:23  jehousley

	* lib/ssh.c: Check both variables, not the same one twice.  Pointed
	  out by Colin Hogben

2007-06-19 14:33  bagder

	* lib/ftp.c, tests/data/Makefile.am, tests/data/test353: and fix
	  another flaw in the singlecwd case when we get ftp://site.com/,
	  also from the #1739100 bug report

2007-06-19 13:50  bagder

	* lib/ssh.c: extra precaution to make PATH_MAX always be defined

2007-06-19 13:31  jehousley

	* lib/: ssh.c, urldata.h: Change rsa and rsa_pub from static arrays
	  in ssh_conn to be dynamically allocated when needed

2007-06-19 00:28  jehousley

	* lib/ssh.c: If LIBSSH2DEBUG was defined "i" was undefined

2007-06-18 23:09  bagder

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES: Robson Braga Araujo filed bug report
	  #1739100 (http://curl.haxx.se/bug/view.cgi?id=1739100) that
	  mentioned that libcurl could not actually list the contents of
	  the root directory of a given FTP server if the login directory
	  isn't root. I fixed the problem and added three test cases (one
	  is disabled for now since I identified KNOWN_BUGS #44, we cannot
	  use --ftp-method nocwd and list ftp directories).

2007-06-18 23:04  bagder

	* lib/ftp.c: make the ftp-method multicwd case possible to LIST the
	  root directory of a server!

2007-06-18 23:04  bagder

	* tests/data/: DISABLED, Makefile.am, test350, test351, test352:
	  Test listing of root dir with the three ftp-methods. KNOWN_BUGS
	  #44 make me disable test 351 by default by I add the test case
	  anyway to make it easier to work on this problem in the future.

2007-06-18 23:03  bagder

	* docs/KNOWN_BUGS: 44. --ftp-method nocwd does not handle URLs
	  ending with a slash properly (it should list the contents of that
	  directory). See test case 351.

2007-06-18 10:57  bagder

	* docs/KNOWN_BUGS: Daniel Johnson reported the tests now run fine
	  on OS X!

2007-06-16 18:58  jehousley

	* lib/ssh.c: Curl_ssh_connect() was using an uninitialized variable
	  in one location.  Caught by the auto-builds

2007-06-14 23:16  bagder

	* tests/sshserver.pl: Tom Regner added /usr/lib/misc to the path to
	  scan for sftp to make the sftp tests run fine on gentoo

2007-06-14 16:42  bagder

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES, lib/multi.c: Shmulik Regev fixed a flaw
	  in the multi interface that occurred when doing HTTP CONNECT over
	  a proxy

2007-06-14 16:15  bagder

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES: s/HAVE_POLL/HAVE_SYS_POLL_H

2007-06-14 15:22  jehousley

	* lib/ssh.c: Remove duplicate code that was left in as part of
	  1.35.  This code only affected sftp_sendquote() for the
	  "chgrp/chmod/chown" commands.

	  This also fixed failure of test 614 on a system that previously
	  failed.

2007-06-14 13:21  bagder

	* lib/select.h: Make our own definitions of the POLL* defiens and
	  the pollfd struct only get done if the sys/poll.h file is
	  missing, as we have seen machines with poll() present but without
	  the header file and machines that don't get HAVE_POLL defined but
	  that do have the sys/poll.h header file...

2007-06-14 12:36  jehousley

	* lib/ssh.c: BUG FIX:  When reading a directory listing that
	  contains symlinks with the latest libssh2, the listing would be
	  truncated at the symlink.  Fix by looping on
	  LIBSSH2_ERROR_EAGAIN, like the rest of the calls.

2007-06-13 22:17  bagder

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES: Tom Regner provided a patch and worked
	  together with James Housley, so now
	  CURLOPT_FTP_CREATE_MISSING_DIRS works for SFTP connections as
	  well as FTP ones.

2007-06-13 22:08  bagder

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES: Rich Rauenzahn filed bug report #1733119
	  (http://curl.haxx.se/bug/view.cgi?id=1733119) and we collaborated
	  on the fix.  The problem is that for 64bit HPUX builds, several
	  socket-related functions would still assume int (32 bit)
	  arguments and not socklen_t (64 bit) ones.

2007-06-13 19:13  jehousley

	* lib/ssh.c: Restore functionality mistakenly removed in the
	  previous commit

2007-06-13 17:02  jehousley

	* docs/: curl.1, libcurl/curl_easy_setopt.3: Update documentation
	  to reflect SFTP's ability to create directories on upload.  Some
	  text provieded by Tom Regner

2007-06-13 16:01  giva

	* lib/ssh.c: libssh2_session_free() returns void. Fix "#endif".

2007-06-13 14:15  jehousley

	* lib/ssh.c: Commit Tom Regner's code for SFTP create missing
	  directories.	This patch uses the --ftp-create-dirs flag to
	  control if cURL will try and create directories that are
	  specified in an upload path, but don't exist.

2007-06-13 13:27  jehousley

	* lib/ssh.c: Add a define to protect the state machine from older
	  versions of libssh2, ie 0.14, that don't know about newer
	  constants used in the state machine.

2007-06-12 23:39  bagder

	* configure.ac, lib/setup_once.h: With lots of help from Rich
	  Rauenza(?) in bug #1733119, we introduce a fairly complicated
	  work-around for 64bit HPUX compiles. We do the fix using inline
	  static functions to make them follow the header file properly and
	  thus get used fine in the test suite too etc.

2007-06-12 23:32  jehousley

	* lib/: ssh.c, urldata.h: * Updates for the latest version of
	  libssh2, specifically   libssh2_sftp_shutdown() and
	  libssh2_session_free() can now return   LIBSSH2_ERROR_EAGAIN.

	  * Fix the _send() and _recv() return values so non-blocking works

2007-06-12 18:15  jehousley

	* lib/ssh.c: While connect and transfer works fine in non-blocking
	  mode for the test suite, transfer fails in the real world.  So
	  after connect set to blocking as full non-blocking is migrated
	  out.

2007-06-12 15:51  bagder

	* CHANGES: mention James current work on ssh

2007-06-12 15:47  jehousley

	* lib/ssh.c: Prevent the state machine from getting stuck in
	  SSH_AUTH_HOST_INIT

2007-06-12 14:31  jehousley

	* lib/: ssh.c, ssh.h, urldata.h: Convert Curl_ssh_connect() to run
	  in a state machine for LIBSSH2_APINO >= 200706012030.  More to
	  come...

2007-06-12 10:15  bagder

	* lib/tftp.c: remove unused field in the state struct

2007-06-11 19:53  danf

	* tests/runtests.pl: Wait longer for servers to start up since the
	  ssh server needs to generate keys the first time (which can take
	  a while on a slow or loaded host).  Enforce a longer startup wait
	  time for the ssh client SOCKS server, too.  Check for an error
	  code from startnew() when starting any server.

2007-06-11 19:49  danf

	* tests/sshserver.pl: We do not use RSA keys in the test suite.

2007-06-11 15:35  bagder

	* lib/hostares.c: restore the correct timeout time that my previous
	  commit broke

2007-06-11 15:32  bagder

	* lib/hostares.c: Properly wait for the c-ares resolve to complete,
	  hopefully the cure for bug #1733955

2007-06-11 09:27  bagder

	* docs/FAQ: Daniel Black's clarfication about the NTLM support

2007-06-11 06:33  giva

	* lib/hostthre.c: constify 'hostname' in init_thread_sync_data().
	  Simply clear the whole 'tsd' structure on exit in
	  destroy_thread_sync_data().

2007-06-11 06:07  giva

	* lib/ssh.c: Squelsh some warnings for libssh older than 0.1.5.

2007-06-08 20:56  danf

	* CHANGES, tests/runtests.pl: Fixed the test harness so that it
	  actually kills the ssh being used as the SOCKS server.

2007-06-08 19:32  danf

	* tests/sshserver.pl: Improved compatibility with perl 5.0 on the
	  'open' calls.

2007-06-08 19:21  danf

	* CHANGES, tests/runtests.pl, tests/data/Makefile.am,
	  tests/data/test706, tests/data/test707: Incorporated Daniel
	  Black's test706 and test707 SOCKS test cases.

2007-06-08 19:03  danf

	* tests/runtests.pl: Improved compatibility with perl 5.0 on the
	  'open' calls.

2007-06-08 18:19  jehousley

	* lib/ssh.c: Curl_scp_done() needs to call libssh2_channel_free()
	  to prevent a memory leak, and it is the right thing to do.

2007-06-08 18:02  jehousley

	* lib/ssh.c: Fix to work with the latest CVS version of libssh2

	  * As of (LIBSSH2_APINO >= 200706012030) there are not *nb()
	  functions * As of (LIBSSH2_APINO >= 200706012030) most
	  libssh2_*() functions   can return LIBSSH2_ERROR_EAGAIN to
	  indicate that the call would block.

	  To make the code work as previously, blocking, all the code has
	  been updated so that when (LIBSSH2_APINO >= 200706012030) it
	  loops simulating blocking.  This allows the existing code to
	  function and not hold up the upcoming release.

2007-06-08 11:01  bagder

	  now be used to toggle off the silence again if used a second
	  time.

	  Daniel S (5 June 2007) - Added Daniel Black's work that adds the
	  first few SOCKS test cases. I also   fixed two minor SOCKS
	  problems to make the test cases run fine.

2007-06-07 23:42  danf

	* tests/sshserver.pl: Renamed the sshd log file to sshd.log.  Added
	  more options to the ssh config file to improve the consistency of
	  the test environment.  Force a rewrite of the ssh config files on
	  every invocation.  Changed the opens to work on older versions of
	  perl.

2007-06-07 22:14  danf

	* tests/data/: test700, test701, test702, test703, test704,
	  test705: Cleaned up SOCKS tests.  Use a magic port number instead
	  of killserver to do nonlistening server tests, like other tests.

2007-06-07 21:49  danf

	* tests/: runtests.pl, sshserver.pl: Fixed some problems in

	  sshserver.pl, data/Makefile.am, data/test700, data/test701,
	  data/test702, data/test704, data/test705: Daniel Black's test
	  suite fixes and initial test cases for SOCKS4/5 using openssh

2007-06-05 15:42  bagder

	* lib/socks.c: if we read zero bytes from the proxy, the connection
	  is broken and we need to bail out

2007-06-05 15:41  bagder

	* lib/url.c: mark connect failures as non-connected when
	  ConnectPlease() fails, like when a connection through a socks
	  proxy doesn't work

2007-06-02 21:48  bagder

	* ares/: CHANGES, ares_process.c, ares_timeout.c, setup.h: Brad

	* lib/multi.c: ouch, two conditionals were turned backwards!

2007-06-01 23:01  bagder

	* lib/multi.c: do the update timer stuff even when

2007-05-31 13:34  bagder

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES, configure.ac, lib/README.ares,
	  lib/easy.c, lib/hostares.c, lib/select.c, lib/select.h: When
	  transferring 500 downloads in parallel with a c-ares enabled
	  build only to find that it crashed miserably, and this was due to
	  some select()isms left in the code. This was due to API
	  restrictions in c-ares 1.3.x, but with the upcoming c-ares 1.4.0
	  this is no longer the case so now libcurl runs much better with
	  c-ares and the multi interface with > 1024 file descriptors in
	  use.

2007-05-31 10:59  bagder

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES, lib/file.c: Feng Tu made (lib)curl

2007-05-30 22:49  bagder

	* ares/: CHANGES, ares.h, ares_destroy.c, ares_init.c: Brad House

2007-05-30 22:04  bagder

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES, docs/libcurl/curl_easy_setopt.3,
	  docs/libcurl/curl_multi_setopt.3, include/curl/multi.h,
	  lib/multi.c: Added CURLMOPT_MAXCONNECTS which is a
	  curl_multi_setopt() option for setting the maximum size of the
	  connection cache maximum size of the multi handle.

2007-05-30 19:15  yangtse

	* tests/runtests.pl: In case of test failure, try not to show log
	  files of other tests

2007-05-30 14:58  bagder

	* ares/: CHANGES, ares.h, ares_process.3, ares_process.c, setup.h:
	  added ares_process_fd() to allow applications to ask for
	  processing on specific sockets and thus avoiding select() and
	  associated functions/macros.	This function will be used by
	  upcoming libcurl releases for this very reason. It also made me
	  export the ares_socket_t type in the public ares.h header file,
	  since ares_process_fd() uses that type for two of the arguments.

2007-05-30 11:24  bagder

	* lib/url.c: remove really annoying debug output that makes life
	  miserable when you do hundreds of parallel transfers...

2007-05-27 00:09  bagder

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES: When working with a problem Stefan Becker
	  had, I found an off-by-one buffer overwrite in Curl_select().
	  While fixing it, I also improved its performance somewhat by
	  changing calloc to malloc and breaking out of a loop earlier
	  (when possible).

2007-05-27 00:02  bagder

	* lib/select.c: Primarily this fixes an off-by-one buffer overwrite
	  (rare but still existing).

	  I also switched from calloc() to malloc() as a minor performance
	  boost since the rest of the code fills in the structs fine anyway
	  - and they must for the case when we use the stack-based auto
	  variable array instead of the allocated one.

	  I made the loop filling in poll_fds[] break when poll_nfds is
	  reached as a minor speed improvement.

2007-05-26 22:50  bagder

	* docs/libcurl/libcurl-multi.3: Clarify a bit about the fact that
	  easy handles remain in the multi stack when transfers are done
	  and need to be removed and closed or re-added.

2007-05-26 22:47  bagder

2007-05-18 12:32  bagder

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES, lib/tftp.c, lib/transfer.c: Feng Tu
	  reported that curl -w did wrong on TFTP transfers in bug report
	  #1715394 (http://curl.haxx.se/bug/view.cgi?id=1715394), and the
	  transfer-related info "variables" were indeed overwritten with
	  zeroes wrongly and have now been adjusted. The upload size still
	  isn't accurate.

2007-05-18 12:12  bagder

	* lib/tftp.c: bail out with error codes on failures

2007-05-17 23:41  bagder

	* CHANGES: they spell five with a v...

2007-05-17 23:40  bagder

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES, lib/tftp.c: Feng Tu pointed out a
	  division by zero error in the TFTP connect timeout code for
	  timeouts less than fice seconds, and also provided a fix for it.

2007-05-17 08:04  danf

	* CHANGES, configure.ac, docs/INSTALL, lib/setup.h: Added support
	  for compiling under Minix 3.1.3 using ACK.

2007-05-16 19:45  danf

	* tests/libtest/test613.pl: Match file times occurring in the
	  morning.

2007-05-15 02:36  danf

	* lib/memdebug.c: Added call to setvbuf (disabled by default for
	  speed) to flush the memdebug log file after every line and avoid
	  losing the last few log entries if curl crashes.

2007-05-15 02:28  danf

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES, docs/curl.1,
	  docs/libcurl/curl_easy_setopt.3, lib/ssh.c,
	  tests/data/Makefile.am, tests/data/test614: Added support for
	  quote commands before a transfer using SFTP and test case 614.
	  Allow SFTP quote commands chmod, chown, chgrp to set a value of
	  0.

2007-05-15 00:03  danf

	* CHANGES, docs/curl.1, tests/data/Makefile.am, tests/data/test613,
	  tests/libtest/Makefile.am, tests/libtest/test613.pl: Added SFTP
	  directory listing test case 613.

2007-05-10 22:03  danf

	* tests/data/: Makefile.am, test408, test409: Added FTPS upload
	  tests 408 and 409.

2007-05-09 20:24  danf

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES, lib/ssh.c: Kristian Gunstone fixed a
	  problem where overwriting an uploaded file with sftp didn't
	  truncate it first, which would corrupt the file if the new file
	  was shorter than the old.

2007-05-09 20:05  danf

	* docs/curl.1: Added the list of SFTP post-quote commands, and
	  fixed a few typos.

2007-05-09 00:14  danf

	* CHANGES, tests/data/Makefile.am, tests/data/test406,
	  tests/data/test407: Added FTPS test cases 406 and 407

2007-05-08 13:34  bagder

	* CHANGES, docs/libcurl/curl_easy_setopt.3,
	  docs/libcurl/libcurl-errors.3, include/curl/curl.h, lib/ssh.c,
	  lib/strerror.c: CURLE_FTP_COULDNT_STOR_FILE is now known as
	  CURLE_UPLOAD_FAILED. This is because I just made SCP uploads
	  return this value if the file size of the upload file isn't given
	  with CURLOPT_INFILESIZE*. Docs updated to reflect this news, and
	  a define for the old name was added to the public header file.

2007-05-07 09:07  bagder

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES, lib/multi.c: James Bursa fixed a bug in
	  the multi handle code that made the connection cache grow a bit
	  too much, beyond the normal 4 * easy_handles.

2007-05-06 10:14  bagder

	* CHANGES: extended the description for the
	  curl_multi_socket_action() change

2007-05-03 22:50  bagder

	* docs/KNOWN_BUGS: 42. Daniel Black filed bug report #1705802 where
	  he accurately mentions that	several FTP-SSL test cases fail
	  when we build libcurl with NSS for TLS/SSL:
	  http://curl.haxx.se/bug/view.cgi?id=1705802

2007-05-03 21:12  danf

	* docs/libcurl/: curl_easy_getinfo.3, curl_easy_setopt.3: Fixed a
	  few typos.

2007-05-03 14:30  bagder

	* docs/libcurl/curl_easy_setopt.3: document the new 200alias
	  behaviour

2007-05-02 22:42  bagder

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES, lib/transfer.c: Anders Gustafsson
	  remarked that requiring CURLOPT_HTTP_VERSION set to 1.0 when
	  CURLOPT_HTTP200ALIASES is used to avoid the problem mentioned
	  below is not very nice if the client wants to be able to use
	  _either_ a HTTP 1.1 server or one within the aliases list... so
	  starting now, libcurl will simply consider 200-alias matches the
	  to be HTTP 1.0 compliant.

2007-05-02 21:13  danf

	* lib/: multi.c, url.c, url.h: Fixed an out of memory handling
	  issue with HTTP pipelines.

2007-05-02 19:35  bagder

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES, lib/transfer.c: Tobias Rundstrom reported
	  a problem they experienced with xmms2 and recent libcurls, which
	  turned out to be the 25-nov-2006 change which treats HTTP
	  responses without Content-Length or chunked encoding as without
	  bodies. We now added the conditional that the above mentioned
	  response is only without body if the response is HTTP 1.1.

2007-05-02 15:52  bagder

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES, docs/examples/hiperfifo.c: - Jeff
	  Pohlmeyer improved the hiperfifo.c example to use the
	  CURLMOPT_TIMERFUNCTION callback option.

2007-05-02 15:47  bagder

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES, lib/multi.c: - Set the timeout for easy
	  handles to expire really soon after addition or   when
	  CURLM_CALL_MULTI_PERFORM is returned from
	  curl_multi_socket*/perform,	to make applications using only
	  curl_multi_socket() to properly function   when adding easy
	  handles "on the fly". Bug report and test app provided by
	  Michael Wallner.

2007-05-02 15:14  bagder

	* CHANGES, CHANGES.0, CHANGES.1999, CHANGES.2000, CHANGES.2001,
	  CHANGES.2002, CHANGES.2003, CHANGES.2004, CHANGES.2005: Merged
	  _all_ old changelogs into the single CHANGES.0 file. Having a new
	  one for every year is giving us too many files! I also split out
	  the changes from 2006 from CHANGES to CHANGES.0 now.

2007-05-02 13:14  bagder

	* lib/sendf.c: spell and language fix

2007-05-02 08:02  danf

	* tests/libtest/lib536.c: Check the return code from
	  curl_multi_add_handle()

2007-05-02 02:50  danf

	* src/main.c: Fixed a logic error in the last patch and another out
	  of memory issue.  Reduce the scope of some variables.

2007-05-01 22:52  danf

	* src/main.c: Improved behaviour in out of memory conditions.

2007-05-01 22:50  danf

	* lib/strdup.c: Use memcpy instead of strcpy to improve
	  performance.

2007-04-30 23:47  bagder

	* configure.ac: brlcad on #curl provided this patch (edited by me)
	  since "configure will fail looking for a C++ preprocessor on
	  libtool-using projects" with the factory- installed libtool
	  version on Mac OS X.

2007-04-30 22:15  danf

	* CHANGES, tests/FILEFORMAT, tests/README, tests/runtests.pl,
	  tests/data/test75, tests/libtest/Makefile.am,
	  tests/libtest/test75.pl: Improved the test harness to allow
	  running test servers on other than the default port numbers,
	  allowing more than one test suite to run simultaneously on the
	  same host.

2007-04-30 21:05  danf

	* tests/data/: test239, test243, test245, test246: Fixed some tests
	  to stop hard-coding the port number.

2007-04-29 09:04  danf

	* lib/url.c: Rearranged some allocs so they will be freed correctly
	  in the error path.

2007-04-28 23:01  bagder

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES, lib/gtls.c: Peter O'Gorman fixed libcurl
	  to not init GnuTLS as early as we did before, since it then inits
	  libgcrypt and libgcrypt is being evil and EXITS the application
	  if it fails to get a fine random seed. That's really not a nice
	  thing to do by a library.

2007-04-28 22:27  bagder

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES, lib/easy.c: Frank Hempel fixed a
	  curl_easy_duphandle() crash on a handle that had been removed
	  from a multi handle, and then fixed another flaw that prevented
	  curl_easy_duphandle() to work even after the first fix - the
	  handle was still marked as using the multi interface.

2007-04-27 10:30  bagder

	* lib/url.c: Move the explictit free of the range string to
	  Curl_close() from Curl_disconnect() since it easy-handle related
	  and not connection-related.

2007-04-27 10:19  bagder

	* lib/url.c: oops, this was supposed to be properly removed

2007-04-27 10:18  bagder

	* lib/url.c: As a follow-up to the removal of the free of the range
	  data in Curl_done() - this moves and re-arranges how range/resume
	  is setup and freed.

2007-04-26 23:30  bagder

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES, lib/transfer.c: Peter O'Gorman found a
	  problem with SCP downloads when the downloaded file was 16385
	  bytes (16K+1) and it turned out we didn't properly always "suck
	  out" all data from libssh2. The effect being that libcurl would
	  hang on the socket waiting for data when libssh2 had in fact
	  already read it all...

2007-04-26 01:18  danf

	* CHANGES, tests/README, tests/runtests.pl: Added support in
	  runtests.pl for "!n" test numbers to disable individual tests.

2007-04-25 22:54  danf

	* lib/ftp.c: Fixed an out of memory handling issue.

2007-04-25 22:20  bagder

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES, lib/url.c: Sonia Subramanian brought our
	  attention to a problem that happens if you set the
	  CURLOPT_RESUME_FROM or CURLOPT_RANGE options and an existing
	  connection in the connection cache is closed to make room for the
	  new one when you call curl_easy_perform(). It would then wrongly
	  free range-related data in the connection close funtion.

2007-04-25 22:09  danf

	* tests/runtests.pl: When displaying log files, truncate the really
	  longs ones such as you would get from a torture test.

2007-04-25 05:00  yangtse

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES, ares/setup_once.h, lib/base64.c,
	  lib/hostip.c, lib/netrc.c, lib/setup_once.h, lib/splay.c,
	  packages/vms/build_vms.com, src/main.c: Steve Little's fixes to
	  allow compilation on VMS 64-bit mode

2007-04-25 01:28  danf

	* tests/runtests.pl: Treat log files and -k the same when running
	  torture tests as when not.

2007-04-24 23:30  danf

	* tests/: ftp.pm, ftpserver.pl: Clear out FTP server options before
	  each new client.  Wait for child processes to die to avoid
	  creating zombies.

2007-04-24 12:18  bagder

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES, lib/sendf.c, lib/transfer.c, lib/url.c,
	  lib/urldata.h: Robert Iakobashvili made the 'master_buffer' get
	  allocated first once it is can/will be used as it then makes the
	  common cases save 16KB of data for each easy handle that isn't
	  used for pipelining.

2007-04-24 01:00  danf

	* CHANGES, tests/data/Makefile.am, tests/data/test610,
	  tests/data/test611, tests/data/test612, tests/libtest/test610.pl:
	  Added tests 610-612 to test more SFTP post-quote commands.

2007-04-24 00:58  danf

	* tests/: FILEFORMAT, README, runtests.pl: Added <postcheck>
	  support to the test harness.

2007-04-23 23:18  danf

	* tests/FILEFORMAT: Mention NSS, <postcmd> commands

2007-04-23 03:51  danf

	* tests/data/test20: Changed another nonexistent host name to be
	  under the haxx.se domain to guarantee against it ever being
	  valid.

2007-04-22 20:17  yangtse

	* lib/: connect.c, ftp.c: Avoid an unnecessary call to
	  gettimeofday() when using custom timeout values.

2007-04-22 11:37  bagder

	* configure.ac: --without-ssl disables OpenSSL only

2007-04-22 11:31  bagder

	* CHANGES, docs/curl.1, src/main.c: - Song Ma's warning if
	  -r/--range is given with a "bad" range, also noted in   the man
	  page now.

2007-04-22 10:51  bagder

	* RELEASE-NOTES: configure fix and new mirror

2007-04-22 10:05  bagder

	* docs/curl.1: clarify a bit on the follow-redirect logic and when
	  curl switches from POST to GET on redirect

2007-04-22 09:36  bagder

	* configure.ac: shell script assigns should not have spaces,
	  hopefully fixes bug #1705177

2007-04-21 23:32  bagder

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES, lib/gtls.c: Daniel Black filed bug
	  #1704675 (http://curl.haxx.se/bug/view.cgi?id=1704675)
	  identifying a double-free problem in the SSL-dealing layer,
	  telling GnuTLS to free NULL credentials on closedown after a
	  failure and a bad #ifdef for NSS when closing down SSL.

2007-04-21 23:24  bagder

	* lib/sslgen.c: Curl_ssl_close(): mark the connection as not using
	  SSL anymore, to better survive getting called twice

2007-04-21 17:32  gknauf

	* ares/Makefile.netware, lib/Makefile.netware: fixed ARFLAGS for
	  CodeWarrior build.

2007-04-20 19:16  danf

	* tests/ftpserver.pl: Changed an error message slightly so it can
	  be caught easier by the autobuild logs scanner.

2007-04-20 09:19  bagder

	* include/curl/curl.h: ifndef check the CURL_MAX_WRITE_SIZE define
	  to allow this value to easier be changed at build time (from
	  command line or similar)

2007-04-20 03:58  yangtse

	* lib/select.c: initialize pending_ms to zero to avoid compiler
	  warning: 'pending_ms' may be used uninitialized in this function

2007-04-20 02:07  yangtse

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES, lib/select.c: - Save one call to
	  curlx_tvnow(), which calls gettimeofday(), in each of
	  Curl_socket_ready(), Curl_poll() and Curl_select() when these are
	  called   with a zero timeout or a timeout value indicating a
	  blocking call should	 be performed.

	    These unnecessary calls to gettimeofday() got introduced in
	  7.16.2 when
	    fixing 'timeout would restart when signal caught while awaiting
	  socket
	    events' on 20 March 2007.

	  - Move some loop breaking logic from the while clause into the
	  loop,   avoiding compiler warning 'assignment within conditional
	  expression'

2007-04-19 22:20  bagder

	* lib/select.c: keep lines < 80 columns

2007-04-19 22:16  yangtse

	* lib/connect.c: fix comment and line spacing

2007-04-18 22:22  danf

	* tests/data/: test100, test102, test105, test109, test110,
	  test111, test112, test113, test114, test115, test116, test117,

	  test521, test526, test527, test528, test530, test532, test533,
	  test534, test538: Various test file cleanups, including using
	  <servercmd> instead of writing directly to ftpserver.cmd and
	  removing unneeded empty sections.

2007-04-18 22:15  bagder

	* lib/ssh.c: clarify the comment about libssh2_sftp_write's return
	  type

2007-04-18 22:11  bagder

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES, lib/ssh.c: - James Housley made SFTP
	  uploads use libssh2's non-blocking API (if available)

2007-04-18 22:02  bagder

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES, lib/progress.c: - Prevent the internal
	  progress meter from updating more frequently than once   per
	  second.

2007-04-18 08:30  danf

	* CHANGES, tests/data/Makefile.am, tests/data/test296,
	  tests/data/test297, tests/data/test298: Added test cases 296, 297
	  and 298 to test --ftp-method handling

2007-04-16 22:54  gknauf

	* ares/Makefile.netware, lib/Makefile.netware: added ranlib when
	  library is created with ar.

2007-04-16 18:52  giva

	* ares/Makefile.dj: No need for USE_MANUAL. Use select_s() instead
	  of select().	Added ares_getopt.o to program sample objects.

2007-04-16 18:34  bagder

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES, docs/libcurl/curl_multi_socket.3,
	  include/curl/multi.h, lib/connect.c, lib/multi.c, lib/select.c,
	  lib/select.h, lib/socks.c, lib/transfer.c, lib/urldata.h: -
	  Robert Iakobashvil added curl_multi_socket_action() to libcurl,
	  which is a   function that deprecates the curl_multi_socket()
	  function. Using the new   function the application tell libcurl
	  what action that was found in the   socket that it passes in.
	  This gives a significant performance boost as it   allows libcurl
	  to avoid a call to poll()/select() for every call to
	  curl_multi_socket*().

2007-04-16 17:35  yangtse

	* ares/: adig.c, ahost.c, ares_getopt.c, ares_getopt.h: move
	  linkage var declarations to ares_getopt.h

2007-04-16 15:53  gknauf

	* ares/Makefile.m32: use Makefile.inc to determine sources.

2007-04-16 15:17  gknauf

	* ares/Makefile.netware: ares_getopt() command-line parser function
	  does not belong to actual c-ares library. It is just a
	  convinience source code helper function for use in example
	  programs adig.c and ahost.c

2007-04-16 13:55  bagder

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES: Jay Austin added "DH PARAMETERS" to the
	  stunnel.pem certificate

2007-04-16 11:08  yangtse

	* ares/CHANGES: ares_getopt() command-line parser function does not
	  belong to actual c-ares library. It is just a convinience source

2007-04-16 11:01  yangtse

	* ares/: Makefile.inc, Makefile.vc6, adig.c, ahost.c, ares.h,
	  ares_getopt.c, ares_getopt.h, vc/adig/adig.dsp,

2007-04-14 18:38  gknauf

	* src/getpass.c: use system-own getpassword() function on NetWare.

2007-04-13 22:59  danf

	* CHANGES, tests/data/Makefile.am, tests/data/test294,
	  tests/data/test295: Added test cases 294 and 295 to test
	  --ftp-account handling

2007-04-13 13:35  yangtse

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES, tests/data/test534: Fix test case 534
	  which started to fail 2007-04-13 due to the existance of a new
	  host on the net with the same silly domain the test was using for
	  a host which was supposed not to exist.

2007-04-13 10:45  yangtse

	* lib/base64.c: proper fix for compiler warning

2007-04-13 10:22  yangtse

	* lib/libcurl.rc, src/curl.rc: Take in account that it can be built
	  with compiler debug info and without the curl memory debugging
	  leak detection code enabled.

2007-04-13 09:57  yangtse

	* lib/: base64.c, inet_pton.c, multi.c: fix compiler warning

2007-04-12 23:53  bagder

2007-04-12 22:41  bagder

	* Makefile.dist: add a 'vc8' target that (re-)builds the
	  */Makefile.vc8 files

2007-04-12 22:09  bagder

	* CHANGES, lib/if2ip.c: Song Ma found a memory leak in the if2ip
	  code if you pass in an interface name longer than the name field
	  of the ifreq struct (typically 6 bytes), as then it wouldn't
	  close the used dummy socket.

2007-04-12 21:14  yangtse

	* ares/vc/: adig/adig.dsp, areslib/areslib.dsp: update MSVC project

2007-04-12 21:01  yangtse

	* ares/: Makefile.inc, Makefile.vc6, adig.c, ahost.c: use

2007-03-31 23:35  bagder

	* src/main.c: Since the str2num() function gets called with the

	  check it for NULL before accessing the str data.  CID 14 of the
	  coverity.com scan

2007-03-31 23:28  bagder

	* src/main.c: check the correct variable to want about --stderr
	  failures properly CID 18 by the coverity.com scan

	  the coverity.com scan

2007-03-31 23:10  bagder

	* lib/ssluse.c: Pointless to check for non-NULL pointers that

	  before this check.  CID 22 in the coverity.com scan

2007-03-31 23:06  bagder

	  the NULL pointer...  CID 6 coverity.com scan

2007-03-31 13:12  bagder

	* lib/getinfo.c: The info types cannot be checked for explicity by
	  ANDing the types since they have not been properly defined to
	  allow this! Instead of changing the defines and break the
	  ABI/API, I opted to modify the code to check for exact type
	  matches.  CID 10 coverity.com scan

2007-03-31 12:56  bagder

	* lib/multi.c: Check for a NULL easy->easy_conn in multi_getsock()

	  called.  CID 13. coverity.com scan

2007-03-31 12:39  bagder

	* lib/ftp.c: Removed check for ftpcode being NULL, as later it is

	  it being valid.  CID 12, coverity.com scan

2007-03-31 05:21  yangtse

	* tests/sshserver.pl: sshd might fail to start if given an

2007-03-20 21:00  yangtse

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES, lib/select.c: Fixed: When a signal was
	  caught awaiting for an event using Curl_select() or Curl_poll()
	  with a non-zero timeout both functions would restart the
	  specified timeout. This could even lead to the extreme case that
	  if a signal arrived with a frecuency lower to the specified
	  timeout neither function would ever exit.

	  Added experimental symbol definition check CURL_ACKNOWLEDGE_EINTR
	  in Curl_select() and Curl_poll(). When compiled with
	  CURL_ACKNOWLEDGE_EINTR defined both functions will return as soon
	  as a signal is caught. Use it at your own risk, all calls to
	  these functions in the library should be revisited and checked
	  before fully supporting this feature.

2007-03-18 23:37  bagder

	  set the "openssl" flag internally since that is the API yassl
	  attempts to provide

2007-03-18 23:36  bagder

	* configure.ac: detect if built with the OpenSSL API "emulated" by
	  yassl

2007-03-18 18:29  yangtse

2007-03-18 05:51  yangtse

	* lib/: select.c, select.h: Code refactoring, extracting a new
	  function wait_ms() from Curl_select and Curl_poll() which is
	  called whenever not a single valid file descriptor is passed to
	  these functions.

	  Improve readibility using a poll() macro to replace WSApoll().

	* lib/ssh.c: Fixed a memory leak.

2007-03-15 00:40  bagder

	* configure.ac, lib/ssluse.c: yassl doesn't have SSL_get_shutdown()

	  this cripples the CCC command

2007-03-14 03:04  danf

	* lib/ssh.c: Fixed a NULL pointer dereference on sftp

	* lib/connect.c: Use Curl_inet_pton() instead of inet_pton().

2007-03-12 21:50  danf

	* tests/runtests.pl: libcurl supplies its own crypto hash functions
	  when SSL is disabled, so 'crypto' tests aren't dependent on SSL.
	  Compiling with --disable-crypto-auth will cause test failures,
	  however.

	* tests/: README, httpsserver.pl, runtests.pl, data/Makefile.am,
	  data/test400: Added test infrastructure to support basic FTPS
	  tests.  This currently supports only ftps:// URLs with
	  --ftp-ssl-control specified, which implicitly encrypts the
	  control channel but not the data channels.  That allows stunnel
	  to be used with an unmodified ftp server in exactly the same way
	  that the test https server is set up.  Added test case 400 as a
	  basic FTPS test.

	  in configure:

	  m4_ifdef([macro], [m4_undefine([macro])])

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES, lib/url.c: - Hang Kin Lau found and
	  fixed: When I use libcurl to connect to an https   server through
	  a proxy and have the remote https server port set using the
	  CURLOPT_PORT option, protocol gets reset to http from https after
	  the first   request.

	    User defined URL was modified internally by libcurl and
	  subsequent reuse of
	    the easy handle may lead to connection using a different
	  protocol (if not
	    originally http).

	    I found that libcurl hardcoded the protocol to "http" when it
	  tries to
	    regenerate the URL if CURLOPT_PORT is set. I tried to fix the
	  problem as
	    follows and it's working fine so far

	* src/: Makefile.Watcom, Makefile.inc, Makefile.m32, Makefile.vc6,
	  curlutil.c, curlutil.h, main.c, makefile.amiga, makefile.dj: curl
	  tool was using functions curlx_tvnow and curlx_tvdiff which are
	  not part of the official libcurl API
	  http://curl.haxx.se/lxr/source/lib/README.curlx The documented
	  way of using them would be to use timeval.c as a source code
	  file.

	  The above described method works very well when statically
	  linking libcurl and apps, curl tool, but has several drawbacks
	  when you build a true shared libcurl (i.e. Name space clash at
	  linkage stage as functions are defined more than once. Windows
	  makefiles are not capable of handling this system of source-level
	  sharing)

	  So...

	  Now curlutil.h and curlutil.c define and implement cutil_tvnow
	  and cutil_tvdiff which replace curlx_tvnow and curlx_tvdiff for
	  the curl tool. Doing this we avoid the above described problems.

	* tests/testcurl.pl: Several corrections & changes to what has been

	  1) The maketgz script does not insert the timestamp in curlver.h,

	  string.

	  2) testcurl.pl will always print the "date" string which
	  represents	the moment the test build is run.

	  3) testcurl.pl may not print the "timestamp" string since the
	  script    may end before it is printed out. (i.e. unable to
	  update from CVS)

	  4) The "timestamp" string printed will be the same as the "date"
	  one	 unless one of the following conditions is met.

	     *) It is a tarball-based build. Timestamp will be creation
	  time.

	     *) CVS update has been done. Timestamp will be end of CVS
	  update.

	  the maketgz script inserts it when the tarball is created. For

	  UTC build time as it is the CVS version timestamp.

	  In this way, all builds will have a valid source code timestamp
	  which isn't related to the moment the tests and build is
	  performed, with the exception of CVS-based ones which have the
	  same "date" and "timestamp"

	  response headers are sent   to the debug callback.

	  - Shmulik Regev added CURLOPT_HTTP_CONTENT_DECODING and
	  CURLOPT_HTTP_TRANSFER_DECODING that if set to zero will disable
	  libcurl's   internal decoding of content or transfer encoded
	  content. This may be	 preferable in cases where you use libcurl

	* tests/libtest/Makefile.am: Include both testutil.c and

2007-02-09 02:17  yangtse

	* tests/libtest/: testutil.c, testutil.h: Some tests were using
	  functions curlx_tvnow and curlx_tvdiff which are not part of the
	  official libcurl API
	  http://curl.haxx.se/lxr/source/lib/README.curlx The documented
	  way of using them would be to use timeval.c as a source code
	  file.

	  The above described method works very well when statically
	  linking libcurl and apps, test programs, but has several
	  drawbacks when you build a true shared libcurl (i.e. Name space
	  clash at linkage stage as functions are defined more than once.
	  Windows makefiles are not capable of handling this system of
	  source-level sharing)

	  So...

	  Now testutil.h and testutil.c define and implement tutil_tvnow
	  and tutil_tvdiff which replace curlx_tvnow and curlx_tvdiff for
	  the libtest programs. Doing this we avoid the above described
	  problems, and the code in the testsuite does not impose the need
	  to keep those functions public in libcurl even when not part of
	  the API.

	  lib/ssluse.c, lib/telnet.c, lib/tftp.c, lib/transfer.c,

	  adds support for CURLOPT_TIMEOUT_MS	and
	  CURLOPT_CONNECTTIMEOUT_MS that, as their names should hint, do
	  the	timeouts with millisecond resolution instead. The only
	  restriction to that	is the alarm() (sometimes) used to abort
	  name resolves as that uses full   seconds. I fixed the FTP
	  response timeout part of the patch.

	    Internally we now count and keep the timeouts in milliseconds
	  but it also
	    means we multiply set timeouts with 1000. The effect of this is
	  that no
	    timeout can be set to more than 2^31 milliseconds (on 32 bit
	  systems), which
	    equals 24.86 days.	We probably couldn't before either since

	* CHANGES, TODO-RELEASE, lib/url.c, tests/runtests.pl: Fixed a
	  dangling pointer problem that prevented the http_proxy
	  environment variable from being properly used in many cases (and
	  caused test case 63 to fail).

2007-01-23 23:57  bagder

	* CHANGES, lib/http_ntlm.c: - David McCreedy did NTLM changes
	  mainly for non-ASCII platforms:

	    #1
	    There's a compilation error in http_ntlm.c if USE_NTLM2SESSION
	  is NOT
	    defined.  I noticed this while testing various configurations.
	  Line 867 of
	    the current http_ntlm.c is a closing bracket for an if/else
	  pair that only
	    gets compiled in if USE_NTLM2SESSION is defined.  But this
	  closing bracket
	    wasn't in an #ifdef so the code fails to compile unless
	  USE_NTLM2SESSION was
	    defined.  Lines 198 and 140 of my patch wraps that closing
	  bracket in an
	    #ifdef USE_NTLM2SESSION.

	    #2
	    I noticed several picky compiler warnings when DEBUG_ME is
	  defined.  I've
	    fixed them with casting.  By the way, DEBUG_ME was a huge help
	  in
	    understanding this code.

	    #3
	    Hopefully the last non-ASCII conversion patch for libcurl in a
	  while.  I
	    changed the "NTLMSSP" literal to hex since this signature must
	  always be in
	    ASCII.

	    Conversion code was strategically added where necessary.  And
	  the
	    Curl_base64_encode calls were changed so the binary "blobs"
	  http_ntlm.c
	    creates are NOT translated on non-ASCII platforms.

	  stuff.

2007-01-23 03:29  danf

	* CHANGES: Convert (most of) the test data files into genuine XML.
	  A handful still are not, due mainly to the lack of support for
	  XML character entities (e.g. & => &amp; ).  This will make it
	  easier to validate test files using tools like xmllint, as well
	  as edit and view them using XML tools.

	  --limit-rate	 (CURLOPT_MAX_SEND_SPEED_LARGE and
	  CURLOPT_MAX_RECV_SPEED_LARGE) are broken   on Windows (since
	  7.16.0, but that's when they were introduced as previous   to
	  that the limiting logic was made in the application only and not
	  in the   library). It was actually also broken on select()-based
	  systems (as apposed	to poll()) but we haven't had any such

	  sleep a while without waiting for anything input or	output when

	  #1618359 (http://curl.haxx.se/bug/view.cgi?id=1618359) and
	  subsequently provided a patch for it: when downloading 2 zero
	  byte files in a row, curl 7.16.0 enters an infinite loop, while
	  curl 7.16.1-20061218 does one additional unnecessary request.

	  Fix: During the "Major overhaul introducing http pipelining
	  support and shared connection cache within the multi handle."
	  change, headerbytecount was moved to live in the
	  Curl_transfer_keeper structure. But that structure is reset in
	  the Transfer method, losing the information that we had about the
	  header size. This patch moves it back to the connectdata struct.

	  "passes" and authenticates a	 connection rather than a HTTP

	  not in the library). This problem is easily	repeated and it
	  takes a Windows person to fire up his/hers debugger in order	 to
	  fix. http://curl.haxx.se/bug/view.cgi?id=1603712

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES, lib/ftp.c, lib/url.c,
	  tests/data/Makefile.am, tests/data/test538: Alexey Simak found
	  out that when doing FTP with the multi interface and something
	  went wrong like it got a bad response code back from the server,
	  libcurl would leak memory. Added test case 538 to verify the fix.

	  I also noted that the connection would get cached in that case,
	  which doesn't make sense since it cannot be re-use when the
	  authentication has failed. I fixed that issue too at the same

	  cases where the connection was about to get closed.

	  connections getting cut off prematurely when --limit-rate is

	  reading of the code, I found that the --limit-rate code was
	  severly flawed (since it was moved into the lib, since 7.15.5)

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES, lib/ftp.c: Alexey Simak filed bug report
	  #1600447 (http://curl.haxx.se/bug/view.cgi?id=1600447) in which
	  he noted that active FTP connections don't work with the multi
	  interface. The problem is here that the multi interface state
	  machine has a state during which it can wait for the data
	  connection to connect, but the active connection is not done in
	  the same step in the sequence as the passive one is so it doesn't
	  quite work for active. The active FTP code still use a blocking
	  function to allow the remote server to connect.

	  The fix (work-around is a better word) for this problem is to set
	  the boolean prematurely that the data connection is completed, so
	  that the "wait for connect" phase ends at once.

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES, lib/select.c: Matt Witherspoon fixed a

	  was disconnected:

	  "What appears to be happening is that my system (Linux 2.6.17 and
	  2.6.13) is setting *only* POLLHUP on poll() when the conditions
	  in my previous mail occur. As you can see, select.c:Curl_select()
	  does not check for POLLHUP. So basically what was happening, is
	  poll() was returning immediately (with POLLHUP set), but when
	  Curl_select() looked at the bits, neither POLLERR or POLLOUT was
	  set. This still caused Curl_readwrite() to be called, which
	  quickly returned. Then the transfer() loop kept continuing at
	  full speed forever."

	  body. Starting now, a HTTP response on a persistent connection
	  (i.e not set to be closed after the response has been taken care
	  of) must have Content-Length or chunked encoding set, or libcurl
	  will simply assume that there is no body.

	  To my horror I learned that we had no less than 57(!) test cases
	  that did bad HTTP responses like this, and even the test http
	  server (sws) responded badly when queried by the test system if
	  it is the test system. So although the actual fix for the problem
	  was tiny, going through all the newly failing test cases got
	  really painful and boring.

	* tests/libtest/: lib518.c, lib537.c: reduce max size of
	  dinamically allocated arrays to minimize the nasty behaviour some
	  versions of IRIX exhibit of committing suicide on big mallocs
	  instead of just returning a friendly null pointer

2006-11-03 04:05  yangtse

	* tests/: runtests.pl, data/Makefile.am, data/test537,
	  libtest/Makefile.am, libtest/lib518.c: test 518 is all about
	  testing libcurl functionality when more than FD_SETSIZE file
	  descriptors are open.  This means that if for any reason we are
	  not able to open more than FD_SETSIZE file descriptors then test
	  518 should not be run.

	  test 537 is all about testing libcurl functionality when the
	  system has nearly exhausted the number of free file descriptors.
	  Test 537 will try to run with very few free file descriptors.

2006-10-31 02:30  yangtse

	  Once that 518 has been verified this change will be undone.

2006-10-31 02:24  yangtse

	* ares/setup_once.h: Sync with lib/setup_once.h

2006-10-27 17:32  yangtse

	* lib/: ldap.c, url.c: Compiler warning fix.

	  Assigning the const value zero to a pointer to function results
	  in a null pointer value assignment to the function pointer.

	  Assignment of any nonzero value is what should result in a
	  implementation compiler dependent result.

	  Since what we want to do here is the first case, this should not
	  trigger compiler warnings related with conversions from 'pointer
	  to data' to 'pointer to function'.

	  Our autobuild test suite will judge.

2006-10-26 16:30  giva

	* tests/libtest/lib525.c: Use proper 'stat' structure for fstat().

2006-10-26 15:55  yangtse

	* tests/libtest/lib518.c: Improved rlimit logic: - Take in account

	  Keep file descriptors open only while runing this test.

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES, docs/curl.1,
	  docs/libcurl/curl_easy_setopt.3, lib/transfer.c,
	  tests/data/Makefile.am, tests/data/test281: Fixed
	  CURLOPT_FAILONERROR to return CURLE_HTTP_RETURNED_ERROR even for
	  the case when 401 or 407 are returned, *IF* no auth credentials
	  have been given.  The CURLOPT_FAILONERROR option is not possible
	  to make fool-proof for 401 and 407 cases when auth credentials is
	  given, but we've now covered this somewhat more.

	  You might get some amounts of headers transferred before this
	  situation is detected, like for when a "100-continue" is received
	  as a response to a POST/PUT and a 401 or 407 is received
	  immediately afterwards.

	  Added test 281 to verify this change.

2006-10-17 12:04  yangtse

	* lib/: ftp.c, http.c, sendf.c, ssluse.c, transfer.c: Explicit

2006-10-17 04:31  yangtse

	* lib/http.c: Compiler warning fix

2006-10-16 10:30  bagder

	* CHANGES, acinclude.m4, configure.ac: Added a check in configure
	  that simply tries to run a program (not when cross-compiling) in
	  order to detect problems with run-time libraries that otherwise
	  would occur when the sizeof tests for curl_off_t would run and
	  thus be much more confusing to users. The check of course should
	  run after all lib-checks are done and before any other test is
	  used that would run an executable built for testing-purposes.

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES, TODO-RELEASE,
	  docs/libcurl/curl_multi_setopt.3, include/curl/multi.h,
	  lib/multi.c: Jeff Pohlmeyer has been working with the hiperfifo.c
	  example source code, and while doing so it became apparent that
	  the current timeout system for the socket API really was a bit
	  awkward since it become quite some work to be sure we have the
	  correct timeout set.

	  Jeff then provided the new CURLMOPT_TIMERFUNCTION that is yet
	  another callback the app can set to get to know when the general
	  timeout time changes and thus for an application like hiperfifo.c
	  it makes everything a lot easier and nicer. There's a
	  CURLMOPT_TIMERDATA option too of course in good old libcurl
	  tradition.

2006-10-12 10:14  bagder

	  Added test case 536 in an attempt to add Bogdan Nicula's

	  possible (error) conditions into account.

2006-10-09 02:35  yangtse

2006-10-07 23:04  bagder

2006-09-20 14:03  bagder

	* lib/: multi.c, url.c: Michael Wallner's test program again help
	  me track down a problem. This time it basically was that we
	  didn't remove the current connection from the pipe list when

	  additional debug code for debug builds helping to check and track
	  down some signs of run-time trouble.

2006-09-20 13:35  bagder

	* docs/curl.1: PEM is default type for key and cert

2006-09-16 23:50  bagder

	* lib/: multi.c, url.c, url.h, urldata.h: Resize the connection
	  cache upwards when adding more handles than what currently fits

	  pipelining cases but also for "mere" (persistent) connection
	  re-use.

2006-09-16 22:57  bagder

	* lib/ftp.c: Armel Asselin - When the easy handle is removed from
	  the multi while libcurl is still trying to resolve the host name,
	  it seems that the ftp struct is not yet initialized, but the
	  removal action calls Curl_done() which calls Curl_ftp_done. So we
	  simply return success from there if no ftp pointer is set.

2006-09-15 10:47  bagder

	* lib/: url.c, url.h: file-local function should be static and not

	  the network	by hand or disconnect the network cable in Windows
	  2000 or Windows XP, my   application gets 127.0.0.1 as the only
	  name server. The problem comes from	'GetNetworkParams'

	  tests/libtest/lib526.c: - Fixed my breakage from earlier today so
	  that doing curl_easy_cleanup() on a	handle that is part of a
	  multi handle first removes the handle from the   stack.

	  - Added CURLOPT_SSL_SESSIONID_CACHE and --no-sessionid to disable

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES: curl_multi_socket() fix thanks to Jeff's
	  test code

2006-09-11 00:15  bagder

	* lib/: multi.c, url.c, urldata.h:   Jeff Pohlmeyer presented a
	  *multi_socket()-using program that exposed a
	    problem with it (SIGSEGV-style). It clearly showed that the
	  existing
	    socket-state and state-difference function wasn't good enough
	  so I rewrote
	    it and could then re-run Jeff's program without any crash. The
	  previous
	    version clearly could miss to tell the application when a
	  handle changed
	    from using one socket to using another.

	    While I was at it (as I could use this as a means to track this
	  problem
	    down), I've now added a 'magic' number to the easy handle
	  struct that is
	    inited at curl_easy_init() time and cleared at
	  curl_easy_cleanup() time that
	    we can use internally to detect that an easy handle seems to be
	  fine, or at
	    least not closed or freed (freeing in debug builds fill the
	  area with 0x13
	    bytes but in normal builds we can of course not assume any
	  particular data
	    in the freed areas).

2006-09-11 00:12  bagder

	* lib/hash.c: Added a useful debug function within #if 0. The
	  function makes it easy to "dump" a hash table which is useful
	  when tracking problems with data stored in one of our hashes.

	  internally was a bit confused about who owned the DNS cache at
	  all times so if you created an easy handle that uses a shared DNS
	  cache and added that to a multi handle it would crash. Now we
	  keep more careful internal track of exactly what kind of DNS
	  cache each easy handle uses: None, Private (allocated for and
	  used only by this single handle), Shared (points to a cache held
	  by a shared object), Global (points to the global cache) or Multi
	  (points to the cache within the multi handle that is
	  automatically shared between all easy handles that are added with
	  private caches).

2006-06-24 00:07  bagder

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES, lib/multi.c: Arve Knudsen found a flaw in
	  curl_multi_fdset() for systems where curl_socket_t is unsigned
	  (like Windows) that could cause it to wrongly return a max fd of
	  -1.

2006-06-22 23:36  bagder

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES, docs/KNOWN_BUGS,
	  docs/libcurl/curl_easy_setopt.3, include/curl/curl.h,
	  lib/multi.c, lib/transfer.c, lib/url.c, lib/urldata.h,
	  src/main.c: Peter Silva introduced CURLOPT_MAX_SEND_SPEED_LARGE
	  and CURLOPT_MAX_RECV_SPEED_LARGE that limit tha maximum rate
	  libcurl is allowed to send or receive data. This kind of adds the
	  the command line tool's option --limit-rate to the library.

	  The rate limiting logic in the curl app is now removed and is
	  instead provided by libcurl itself. Transfer rate limiting will
	  now also work for -d and -F, which it didn't before.

2006-06-19 08:41  wahern

	* ares/: CHANGES, ares_dns.h: Remove "big endian" DNS section and
	  RR data integer parser macros from ares_dns.h, which break c-ares
	  on my Sparc64. Bit-wise operations in C operate on logical
	  values. And in any event the octets are already in big-endian
	  (aka network) byte order so they're being reversed (thus the
	  source of the breakage).

2006-06-19 03:18  wahern

	* ares/: CHANGES, ares_process.c: Handle EAGAIN/EWOULDBLOCK
	  readiness errors, which can occur for both TCP and UDP even when
	  a poll(2) or select(2) suggest otherwise.

2006-06-16 09:27  bagder

	* docs/curl.1: when mentioning the default config file, point back
	  to the actual description of how to write such a file

2006-06-15 23:30  bagder

	* lib/transfer.c: select_res is not a socket, it should be a plain
	  int

2006-06-13 19:43  danf

	* configure.ac: Check whether gcc supports --enable-hidden-symbols
	  before allowing it.

2006-06-12 22:33  danf

	* docs/INSTALL, configure.ac, include/curl/curl.h: Implemented
	  --enable-hidden-symbols configure option to enable
	  -fvisibility=hidden on gcc >= 4.0.  This reduces the size of the
	  libcurl binary and speeds up dynamic linking by hiding all the
	  internal symbols from the symbol table.

2006-06-08 13:06  bagder

	* docs/libcurl/curl_easy_getinfo.3: corrected the

	* lib/multi.c: adapted to the new Curl_splayremovebyaddr() proto

2006-05-28 00:25  bagder

	* lib/splay.c: Ifdef'ed out unused function, added lots of comments
	  and renamed a few variables, simplified the splayprint function,
	  modified Curl_splayremovebyaddr() to return error code. All in an
	  effort to track down the reported splay problem, but I've failed
	  to do that so far...

2006-05-27 13:36  bagder

	* tests/testcurl.pl: reverted the previous .libs check for libs,
	  but instead make mingw32 builds more similar to other configure
	  builds (== use .la for libext and no binext)

2006-05-27 00:23  bagder

	* CHANGES, lib/libcurl.framework.make: scar Morales Viv updated
	  the libcurl.framework.make file.

2006-05-26 01:04  bagder

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES, lib/http_digest.c: Olaf Stben fixed a
	  bug that caused Digest authentication with md5-sess to fail. When

	  transformed.

2006-05-25 13:15  bagder

	* docs/: MANUAL, curl.1: minor RFC updates, Dan Fandrich brought my
	  attention to them

2006-05-25 13:04  bagder

	* tests/testcurl.pl: better check for libs created in the .libs
	  directory since libtool does this kind of magic

2006-05-25 01:16  bagder

	* CHANGES: added some missing items

2006-05-25 01:02  bagder

	* ares/: Makefile.am, configure.ac: Copied the NO_UNDEFINED magic
	  from libcurl to make this build fine again with libtool
	  cross-compiled on linux with mingw32

2006-05-25 00:46  bagder

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES, docs/libcurl/curl_easy_setopt.3,
	  lib/cookie.c, lib/cookie.h, lib/url.c: Michael Wallner provided a
	  patch that allows "SESS" to be set with CURLOPT_COOKIELIST, which
	  then makes all session cookies get cleared. (slightly edited by
	  me, and the re-indent in cookie.c was also done by me)

2006-05-24 23:39  bagder

	* tests/server/util.c: make sure we pass a time_t * to localtime(),

2006-05-24 18:11  bagder

	* lib/splay.c: minor fix to make Curl_splayremove() return a NULL
	  as "removed" in case nothing matched fine

2006-05-24 17:22  bagder

	* tests/: data/test271, server/tftpd.c: based on Tor Arntsen's fix,
	  this should correct test case 271 to again run fine

2006-05-24 00:55  bagder

	* configure.ac: Fixed a shell script syntax error that all of a
	  sudden started causing this script to fail on debian unstable
	  (some specific bash version perhaps?)

2006-05-23 23:19  bagder

2006-05-12 00:24  bagder

	* docs/examples/: Makefile.am, ftpuploadresume.c: The new
	  ftpuploadresume.c example by Philip Bock

2006-05-11 23:37  bagder

	* configure.ac: Ok, when checking for old-style SSLeay headers we
	  cannot just use AC_CHECK_HEADERS() and the action-if-found since
	  that action is run even if just one of the six headers is found
	  and I just now fell over a case with a duplicate file name (a
	  krb4 implementation with an err.h file).

	  I converted the check to manually make sure three of the headers
	  are present before considering them fine.

2006-05-11 08:34  bagder

	* tests/: runtests.pl, data/test190: 1 - allow much longer time for
	  the test FTP server to startup and get verified 2 - store the
	  time it took to verify it and allow that time to be used as
	  %FTPTIME[23] in command lines to allow us to adjust better to
	  slow hosts   since test 190 failed on my slow solaris machine
	  just because it hadn't   gotten time to run all the way the test
	  assumed all machines would reach   before the time-out elapsed.

2006-05-11 07:17  bagder

	* lib/getinfo.c: make sure the LASTSOCKET check only checks for SSL
	  status if the socket truly use SSL

2006-05-11 07:16  bagder

	* lib/sslgen.c: silence warning

2006-05-11 00:17  bagder

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES, lib/getinfo.c, lib/sslgen.c,
	  lib/sslgen.h, lib/ssluse.c, lib/ssluse.h: David McCreedy provided
	  a fix for CURLINFO_LASTSOCKET that does extended checks on the
	  to-be-returned socket to make sure it truly seems to be alive and
	  well. For SSL connection it (only) uses OpenSSL functions.

2006-05-10 23:38  bagder

	* tests/runtests.pl: My Solaris test server was simply too slow to
	  be able to respond within 4 seconds even when everything is fine!
	  Now we allow a test server 8 seconds to respond to still be
	  considered ok.

2006-05-10 16:16  bagder

	* packages/AIX/: .cvsignore, RPM/.cvsignore: cvsignore these files

2006-05-10 13:44  bagder

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES, lib/dict.c: 1 - allow DICT with properly
	  URL-escaped words, like using %20 for spaces 2 - properly escape
	  certain letters within a DICT word to comply to the RFC2229

2006-05-10 11:53  bagder

	* tests/server/sws.c: removed variable declarations shadowing
	  previously declared variables

2006-05-10 10:03  bagder

	* ares/: CHANGES, acinclude.m4, configure.ac: Bram Matthys brought
	  my attention to a libtool peculiarity where detecting things such
	  as C++ compiler actually is a bad thing and since we don't need
	  that detection I added a work-around, much inspired by a previous
	  patch by Paolo Bonzini. This also shortens the configure script
	  quite a lot.

2006-05-09 15:02  bagder

	* lib/tftp.c: oops, could return an uninitialized variable

2006-05-09 14:56  bagder

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES, docs/libcurl/libcurl.m4: Andreas Ntaflos
	  reported a bug in libcurl.m4: When configuring my GNU autotools
	  project, which optionally (default=yes) uses libcurl on a system
	  without a (usable) libcurl installation, but not specifying
	  `--without-libcurl', configure determines correctly that no
	  libcurl is available, however, the LIBCURL variable gets expanded
	  to `LIBCURL = -lcurl' in the resulting Makefiles.

	  David Shaw fixed the flaw.

2006-05-09 14:44  bagder

	* RELEASE-NOTES: mention the other TFTP cleanup sweep from yday

2006-05-09 14:43  bagder

	* CHANGES, lib/ssluse.c: Robson Braga Araujo fixed two problems in
	  the recently added non-blocking SSL connects. The state machine
	  was not reset properly so that subsequent connects using the same
	  handle would fail, and there were two memory leaks.

2006-05-09 13:33  bagder

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES, lib/multi.c: Robson Braga Araujo fixed a
	  memory leak when you added an easy handle to a multi stack and
	  that easy handle had already been used to do one or more easy
	  interface transfers, as then the code threw away the previously
	  used DNS cache without properly freeing it.

2006-05-09 00:23  bagder

	* lib/tftp.c: check more return codes and skip the initial slash in
	  given file names

2006-05-08 23:00  bagder

	* lib/tftp.c: no longer uses errno but Curl_sockerrno() and now
	  acknowledges return codes from Curl_client_write

2006-05-08 21:41  danf

	* lib/tftp.c: Stop sending retransmitted received blocks up to
	  client Fixed handling of retransmitted blocks on transmit
	  Properly aligned data to transmit within packet Replaced calls to
	  strerror() with Curl_strerror()

2006-05-08 17:09  bagder

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES, docs/KNOWN_BUGS, lib/tftp.c: Fixed known
	  bug #28. The TFTP code no longer assumes a packed struct and thus
	  works reliably on more platforms.

2006-05-07 20:27  bagder

	* lib/urldata.h: Fix GnuTLS compile warning. Risking breakage with
	  some older version of GnuTLS?

2006-05-06 00:14  bagder

	* lib/http.c: Curl_https_getsock() was OpenSSL-specific and really
	  should not be present like this in this source file. The quickfix
	  for now is to provide a simple version for GnuTLS builds. The
	  GnuTLS version of libcurl doesn't yet allow fully non-blocking
	  connects anyway so this function doesn't get used.

2006-05-06 00:07  bagder

	* lib/hostares.c: get the Curl_sockerrno proto

2006-05-05 23:08  bagder

	  lib/tftp.c: Roland Blom filed bug report #1481217
	  (http://curl.haxx.se/bug/view.cgi?id=1481217), with follow-ups by
	  Michele Bini and David Byron. libcurl previously wrongly used
	  GetLastError() on windows to get error details after
	  socket-related function calls, when it really should use
	  WSAGetLastError() instead.

	  When changing to this, the former function Curl_ourerrno() is now
	  instead called Curl_sockerrno() as it is necessary to only use it
	  to get errno from socket-related functions as otherwise it won't
	  work as intended on Windows.

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES, lib/gtls.c: Mark Eichin submitted bug
	  report #1480821 (http://curl.haxx.se/bug/view.cgi?id=1480821) He
	  found and identified a problem with how libcurl dealt with GnuTLS
	  and a case where gnutls returned GNUTLS_E_AGAIN indicating it
	  would block. It would then return an unexpected return code,
	  making Curl_ssl_send() confuse the upper layer - causing random
	  28 bytes trash data to get inserted in the transfered stream.

	  The proper fix was to make the Curl_gtls_send() function return
	  the proper return codes that the callers would expect. The
	  Curl_ossl_send() function already did this.

2006-05-04 00:39  bagder

	* ares/configure.ac: moved the curl_off_t check to within the
	  --enable-debug block where it belongs since it is a somewhat ugly
	  hack

2006-05-03 08:11  bagder

	* ares/: CHANGES, ares.h, ares__close_sockets.c, ares_cancel.c,
	  ares_destroy.c, ares_init.3, ares_init.c, ares_private.h,
	  ares_process.c: Nick Mathewson added the ARES_OPT_SOCK_STATE_CB
	  option that when set makes c-ares call a callback on socket state
	  changes. A better way than the ares_getsock() to get full control
	  over the socket state.

2006-05-03 00:48  bagder

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES, curl-config.in, docs/curl-config.1:

	  mentioned by Manfred Schwarb

2006-04-25 22:49  bagder

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES, lib/content_encoding.c: Paul Querna fixed
	  libcurl to better deal with deflate content encoding when the

	  case on too many actual server implementations.

2006-04-25 07:32  bagder

	* lib/multi.c: prevent signed/unsigned warnings

2006-04-25 00:41  bagder

2006-04-20 12:26  gknauf

	* ares/Makefile.netware, lib/Makefile.netware,
	  src/Makefile.netware: removed  -fpack-struct because gcc4 seems
	  to know its obsolete and warns...

2006-04-19 13:11  bagder

	* acinclude.m4, configure.ac: detect ICC and pass on "-we 147" so
	  that the configure checks for function arguments work properly -

	  either!

2006-04-19 11:08  bagder

	* docs/libcurl/: curl_easy_setopt.3, curl_version_info.3: the new

2006-04-19 11:03  bagder

	* include/curl/curl.h, lib/version.c: CURL_VERSION_CONV is returned

2006-04-19 01:14  bagder

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES, lib/ftp.c: Robson Braga Araujo provided a

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES: mention Katie Wang as author of the patch

2006-04-19 00:10  bagder

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES, src/main.c: #1468330
	  (http://curl.haxx.se/bug/view.cgi?id=1468330) pointed out a bad
	  typecast in the curl tool leading to a crash with (64bit?) VS2005
	  (at least) since the struct timeval field tv_sec is an int while
	  time_t is 64bit.

2006-04-11 09:23  bagder

	* lib/hostthre.c: adjusted to the new internal *_getsock() concept

	* docs/libcurl/Makefile.am: adding the new man pages to the package

2006-04-10 23:49  bagder

	* lib/ssluse.c: Ates Goral found out that if you specified both
	  CURLOPT_CONNECTTIMEOUT and CURLOPT_TIMEOUT, the _longer_ time

2006-04-10 15:31  bagder

	* configure.ac: check for fork() as well, so that we can build the
	  sws http test server with fork support for cooler tests

2006-04-10 15:14  bagder

	* lib/setup.h: avoid duplicate typedefs, as this type is also
	  defined in our public headers

2006-04-10 15:12  bagder

	* include/curl/multi.h: curl_multi_socket() updates

2006-04-10 15:11  bagder

	* tests/server/sws.c: if configure found a fork(), sws supports
	  --fork which is *NOT* used by the ordinary test suite. Also
	  removed the perror() calls and instead made the logging output
	  the errno code to ease error tracking using logs.

2006-04-10 15:10  bagder

	* tests/httpsserver.pl: output the exit code from stunnel to stderr
	  in case it is non-zero

2006-04-10 15:09  bagder

	* tests/httpserver.pl: support --fork and pass that on to sws

2006-04-10 15:03  bagder

	* tests/runtests.pl: Scan for 'stunnel4' before 'stunnel' since
	  debian have them setup this way and it should break most other
	  systems. The "funny" part is that debian actually have a
	  'stunnel' setup to simulate stunnel v3 but it breaks our own
	  stunnel-version-detect-and-adjust-to-it system.

	  Added initial support for optionally running servers with fork
	  support.

2006-04-10 14:26  bagder

	* tests/data/: test169, test239, test243: Use correct
	  content-length. Found out by patching the libcurl read to only
	  read one byte at a time...

2006-04-10 10:24  bagder

	* docs/KNOWN_BUGS: 33. Doing multi-pass HTTP authentication on a
	  non-default port does not work.    This happens because the
	  multi-pass code abuses the redirect following code	for doing
	  multiple requests, and when we following redirects to an absolute
	  URL we must use the newly specified port and not the one
	  specified in the    original URL. A proper fix to this would need
	  to separate the negotiation	 "redirect" from an actual
	  redirect.

2006-04-10 10:17  bagder

	* TODO-RELEASE: 65 - curl_multi_socket() added but not extensively
	  tested nor particularly      documented or pushed for.

2006-04-07 14:10  bagder

	* src/urlglob.c: minor re-arrange to return a value in order to
	  avoid compiler warnings for not returning a value from a non-void
	  function (even though the code never actually reached that point
	  before)

2006-04-07 13:47  bagder

	* lib/: url.c, urldata.h: added typedefed function pointers and
	  typecast the NULL assignments in an attempt to silence picky
	  compilers when assigning data pointers to a function pointer
	  variable

2006-04-07 13:46  bagder

	  NTLM code to work for his "weird IIS case"
	  (http://curl.haxx.se/mail/lib-2006-02/0154.html) by adding the
	  NTLM hash function in addition to the LM one and making some
	  other adjustments in the order the different parts of the data
	  block are sent in the Type-2 reply.  Inspiration for this work
	  was taken from the Firefox NTLM implementation.

	  I edited the existing 21(!) NTLM test cases to run fine with
	  these news. Due to the fact that we now properly include the host
	  name in the Type-2 message the test cases now only compare parts
	  of that chunk.

2006-03-28 12:08  bagder

	* include/curl/mprintf.h: for the CURLDEBUG case, we redefine

	  original URL had more than one question mark (?). Added test case
	  276 to verify.

2006-03-28 09:51  bagder

	* src/urlglob.c: converted sprintf() to snprintf() to reduce risk

2006-03-27 23:59  bagder

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES, src/main.c: David Byron found a problem
	  multiple -d options when libcurl was built with --enable-debug,

	  malloc() and with libcurl-provided functions, when the latter
	  MUST be freed with curl_free() in debug builds.

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES, lib/url.c, lib/urldata.h: Markus Koetter
	  filed debian bug report #355715 which identified a problem with
	  the multi interface and multi-part formposts. The fix from
	  February 22nd could make the Curl_done() function get called

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES, lib/ftp.c: Peter Heuchert made sure the
	  CURLFTPSSL_CONTROL setting for CURLOPT_FTP_SSL is used properly.

2006-03-06 23:35  bagder

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES, lib/ssluse.c: Lots of users on Windows
	  have reported getting the "SSL: couldn't set callback" error
	  message so I've now made the setting of that callback not be as
	  critical as before. The function is only used for additional
	  loggging/ trace anyway so a failure just means slightly less
	  data. It should still be able to proceed and connect fine to the
	  server.

2006-02-26 18:08  giva

	* lib/: config-win32.h, config.dj, connect.c: Use getprotobyname()

2006-02-23 13:21  bagder

	* TODO-RELEASE: the last planned fix is done

2006-02-23 13:20  bagder

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES, lib/hostip.h, lib/multi.c, lib/url.c:
	  Lots of work and analysis by "xbx___" in bug #1431750
	  (http://curl.haxx.se/bug/view.cgi?id=1431750) helped me identify
	  and fix two different but related bugs:

	  1) Removing an easy handle from a multi handle before the
	  transfer is done    could leave a connection in the connection
	  cache for that handle that is    in a state that isn't suitable
	  for re-use. A subsequent re-use could then	read from a NULL
	  pointer and segfault.

	  2) When an easy handle was removed from the multi handle, there
	  could be an	 outstanding c-ares DNS name resolve request. When
	  the response arrived,    it caused havoc since the connection
	  struct it "belonged" to could've    been freed already.

	  Now Curl_done() is called when an easy handle is removed from a
	  multi handle pre-maturely (that is, before the transfer was
	  complteted). Curl_done() also makes sure to cancel all (if any)
	  outstanding c-ares requests.

2006-02-23 00:55  danf

	* docs/KNOWN_BUGS, tests/data/test57: Fixed test case 57 (KNOWN_BUG
	  #18)

2006-02-22 20:09  danf

	* lib/url.c: Fixed some spelling errors in comments, and extraneous
	  \n in failf logs.

2006-02-21 16:25  bagder

	* src/main.c: two typos in comments

2006-02-21 08:46  bagder

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES, docs/curl.1,
	  docs/libcurl/curl_easy_setopt.3, lib/url.c, src/main.c: Peter Su
	  added support for SOCKS4 proxies. Enable this by setting the
	  proxy type to the already provided type CURLPROXY_SOCKS4.  I
	  added a --socks4 option that works like the current --socks5
	  option but instead use the socks4 protocol.

2006-02-20 11:05  bagder

	* docs/KNOWN_BUGS: ftp upload with url ending with slash

2006-02-20 00:16  bagder

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES, lib/transfer.c: Shmulik Regev fixed an
	  issue with multi-pass authentication and compressed content when
	  libcurl didn't honor the internal ignorebody flag.

2006-02-18 23:27  bagder

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES, lib/http_negotiate.c, tests/server/sws.c:
	  Ulf Hrnhammar fixed a format string (printf style) problem in
	  the Negotiate code. It should however not be the cause of any
	  troubles. He also fixed a few similar problems in the HTTP test
	  server code.

2006-02-17 16:58  yangtse

2006-02-17 00:42  bagder

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES, TODO-RELEASE, lib/hostip.c: Shmulik Regev
	  provided a fix for the DNS cache when using short life times, as
	  previously it could be holding on to old cached entries longer
	  than requested.

2006-02-16 20:19  danf

	* docs/KNOWN_BUGS: Gopher is no longer supported.

2006-02-16 13:11  bagder

	* TODO-RELEASE: two items before release

2006-02-16 11:02  bagder

	* lib/url.c: Added some clarifying comments

2006-02-15 10:36  bagder

	* docs/KNOWN_BUGS: 32. (At least on Windows) If libcurl is built
	  with c-ares and there's no DNS   server configured in the system,
	  the ares_init() call fails and thus	curl_easy_init() fails as
	  well. This causes weird effects for people who use   numerical IP
	  addresses only.

2006-02-11 23:36  bagder

	* docs/libcurl/curl_easy_getinfo.3: mention the
	  CURLOPT_CONNECT_ONLY connection

2006-02-11 23:35  bagder

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES, docs/libcurl/curl_easy_getinfo.3,
	  docs/libcurl/curl_easy_setopt.3, include/curl/curl.h, lib/easy.c,
	  lib/ftp.c, lib/getinfo.c, lib/http.c, lib/multi.c,
	  lib/transfer.c, lib/url.c, lib/urldata.h: Karl M added the
	  CURLOPT_CONNECT_ONLY and CURLINFO_LASTSOCKET options that an app
	  can use to let libcurl only connect to a remote host and then
	  extract the socket from libcurl. libcurl will then not attempt to
	  do any transfer at all after the connect is done.

2006-02-11 13:56  bagder

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES, configure.ac: Kent Boortz improved the
	  configure check for GnuTLS to properly set LIBS instead of
	  LDFLAGS.

2006-02-09 23:25  bagder

	* docs/libcurl/libcurl-tutorial.3: CURLOPT_NOSIGNAL might be a MUST
	  to make threaded use work, like on AIX 5.2 due to the use of the
	  static variable for sigsetjmp()

2006-02-08 00:09  bagder

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES, lib/transfer.c: Philippe Vaucher provided
	  a brilliant piece of test code that show a problem with re-used
	  FTP connections. If the second request on the same connection was
	  set not to fetch a "body", libcurl could get confused and
	  consider it an attempt to use a dead connection and would go
	  acting mighty strange.

2006-02-07 19:56  bagder

	* src/main.c: avoid illegal memory access when doing "-T [URL]
	  [URL]"

2006-02-07 15:03  bagder

	* docs/libcurl/libcurl-tutorial.3: Rene Bernhardt found this typo

2006-02-06 21:02  bagder

	* tests/data/test46: how silly, the cookie expired! ;-)

2006-02-04 19:08  bagder

	* docs/examples/: Makefile.am, README, synctime.c: Frank's
	  synctime.c example and an updated list in README

2006-02-02 00:28  bagder

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES, src/main.c: fixed --limit-rate

2006-02-02 00:26  bagder

	* src/main.c: Make --limit-rate [num] mean bytes. Seems I broke it
	  back in november 2005...

2006-01-30 19:57  giva

	* lib/connect.c: Squelch the "warning: 'port' might be used
	  uninitialized in this function".  (occurs w/o ENABLE_IPV6).

2006-01-30 09:24  bagder

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES, docs/curl.1,
	  docs/libcurl/curl_easy_setopt.3, include/curl/curl.h,
	  lib/connect.c, lib/url.c, lib/urldata.h, src/main.c: Added
	  CURLOPT_LOCALPORT and CURLOPT_LOCALPORTRANGE to libcurl. Set with
	  the curl tool with --local-port. Plain and simply set the range
	  of ports to bind the local end of connections to. Implemented on
	  to popular demand.

	  Not extensively tested. Please let me know how it works.

2006-01-30 09:20  bagder

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES, lib/transfer.c: Based on an error report
	  by Philippe Vaucher, we no longer count a retried connection
	  setup as a follow-redirect. It turns out 1) this fails when a FTP
	  connection is re-setup and 2) it does make the max-redirs counter
	  behave wrong. This fix was not verified since the reporter
	  vanished, but I believe this is the right fix nonetheless.

2006-01-29 14:13  bagder

	* RELEASE-NOTES: more mirrors

2006-01-28 14:14  bagder

	* docs/TODO: we should fix the system includes in the public
	  headers to be based on checks of the system instead of depending
	  on what particular systems we think need various headers

2006-01-28 14:13  bagder

	* include/curl/multi.h: include sys/select.h on NetBSD as well

2006-01-27 22:23  bagder

	* docs/libcurl/libcurl-errors.3: typo pointed out by Mike Griffiths

2006-01-27 16:01  bagder

	* docs/libcurl/curl_easy_setopt.3: Cyrill Osterwalder pointed out
	  that sending "" as data in a header is in fact equal to a blank
	  one according to the spec.

2006-01-26 11:39  bagder

	* lib/krb4.c: updated source header

2006-01-24 15:40  bagder

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES, lib/ftp.c, tests/data/test238: Michal
	  Marek provided a patch for FTP that makes libcurl continue to try
	  PASV even after EPSV returned a positive response code, if
	  libcurl failed to connect to the port number the EPSV response
	  said. Obviously some people are going through protocol-sensitive
	  firewalls (or similar) that don't understand EPSV and then they
	  don't allow the second connection unless PASV was used. This also
	  called for a minor fix of test case 238.

2006-01-20 19:56  danf

	* docs/curl.1: Fixed some statements about handling multiple
	  occurrences of options.  Tried to make some of the wording a bit
	  more consistent.

2006-01-20 18:50  bagder

	* RELEASE-NOTES: the second -P fix

2006-01-20 00:52  bagder

	* CHANGES, lib/ftp.c, lib/url.c, lib/urldata.h, tests/data/test212:
	  Duane Cathey was one of our friends who reported that curl -P
	  [IP] (CURLOPT_FTPPORT) didn't work for ipv6-enabed curls if the
	  IP wasn't a "native" IP while it works fine for ipv6-disabled
	  builds!

	  In the process of fixing this, I removed the support for LPRT
	  since I can't think of many reasons to keep doing it and asking
	  on the mailing list didn't reveal anyone else that could either.
	  The code that sends EPRT and PORT is now also a lot simpler than
	  before (IMHO).

2006-01-19 23:02  bagder

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES, lib/ftp.c: Jon Turner pointed out that
	  doing -P [hostname] with curl (built ipv4-only) didn't work.

2006-01-19 21:40  bagder

	* docs/curl.1: clarify what "-P -" does

2006-01-19 10:53  bagder

2006-01-18 11:00  bagder

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES, acinclude.m4: configure no longer warns

2006-01-17 18:39  bagder

	* docs/libcurl/libcurl.m4: David Shaw: Here is the latest
	  libcurl.m4 autoconf tests.  It is updated with the latest
	  features and protocols that libcurl supports and has a minor fix
	  to better deal with the obscure case where someone has more than
	  one libcurl installed at the same time.

2006-01-17 08:53  bagder

	* COPYING: happy new year!

2006-01-16 23:14  bagder

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES, configure.ac, curl-config.in, docs/FAQ,
	  docs/FEATURES, docs/INSTALL, docs/MANUAL, docs/curl-config.1,

	  packages/Linux/RPM/curl.spec.in, packages/Win32/cygwin/README,
	  perl/contrib/checklinks.pl.in, tests/README, tests/runtests.pl:
	  David Shaw finally removed all traces of Gopher and we are now
	  officially not supporting it. It hasn't been functioning for
	  years anyway, so this is just finally stating what already was
	  true. And a cleanup at the same time.

2006-01-16 01:00  bagder

	* docs/curl.1: improved the description of the -L/--location option

2006-01-16 00:55  bagder

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES, docs/libcurl/curl_easy_init.3,
	  docs/libcurl/curl_global_cleanup.3,
	  docs/libcurl/curl_global_init.3, docs/libcurl/libcurl.3,
	  lib/easy.c: Bryan Henderson turned the 'initialized' variable for
	  curl_global_init() into a counter, and thus you can now do
	  multiple curl_global_init() and you are then supposed to do the
	  same amount of calls to curl_global_cleanup().  Bryan also
	  updated the docs accordingly.

2006-01-16 00:17  bagder

	* hiper/shiper.c: adjusted to use curl_multi_setopt() to set the
	  callback

2006-01-16 00:15  bagder

2006-01-13 13:16  bagder

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES, tests/runtests.pl: Andrew Benham fixed a

2006-01-12 23:18  bagder

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES, lib/ftp.c: Fixed FTP_SKIP_PASV_IP and

2006-01-11 00:08  bagder

	* CHANGES: mention the "secret" option as I've got no feedback and
	  it is actually present in 7.15.1

2006-01-11 00:03  bagder

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES, lib/ftp.c, lib/urldata.h: When using a
	  bad path over FTP, as in when libcurl couldn't CWD into all given
	  subdirs, libcurl would still "remember" the full path as if it is
	  the current directory libcurl is in so that the next
	  curl_easy_perform() would get really confused if it tried the
	  same path again - as it would not issue any CWD commands at all,
	  assuming it is already in the "proper" dir.

	  Starting now, a failed CWD command sets a flag that prevents the
	  path to be "remembered" after returning.

	* ares/AUTHORS: Yang Tse has been helping out

2006-01-05 00:02  bagder

2006-01-03 23:47  bagder

	* tests/server/: Makefile.am, tftp.h: Added remake of the

	  only POLLHUP on remote connection closure so we check for that
	  case (too) and re-enable poll for cygwin builds.

2005-11-08 15:15  bagder

	* CHANGES, configure.ac, lib/Makefile.vc6, lib/http_ntlm.c,
	  src/Makefile.vc6: Dmitry Bartsevich discovered some issues in
	  compatibilty of SSPI-enabled version of libcurl with different
	  Windows versions. Current version of libcurl imports SSPI
	  functions from secur32.dll. However, under Windows NT 4.0 these
	  functions are located in security.dll, under Windows 9x - in
	  secur32.dll and Windows 2000 and XP contains both these DLLs
	  (security.dll just forwards calls to secur32.dll).

	  Dmitry's patch loads proper library dynamically depending on
	  Windows version. Function InitSecurityInterface() is used to
	  obtain pointers to all of SSPI function in one structure.  :

	* docs/KNOWN_BUGS: 27. "libcurl built with GNUTLS ignores the

	* lib/ldap.c: Use an empty '*mod_name'.

2005-10-31 09:55  bagder

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES, lib/ldap.c: Vilmos Nebehaj improved
	  libcurl's LDAP abilities:

	  The LDAP code in libcurl can't handle LDAP servers of LDAPv3 nor
	  binary attributes in LDAP objects. So, I made a quick patch to
	  address these problems.

	  The solution is simple: if we connect to an LDAP server, first
	  try LDAPv3 (which is the preferred protocol as of now) and then
	  fall back to LDAPv2.	In case of binary attributes, we first
	  convert them to base64, just like the openldap client does. It
	  uses ldap_get_values_len() instead of ldap_get_values() to be
	  able to retrieve binary attributes correctly. I defined the
	  necessary LDAP macros in lib/ldap.c to be able to compile libcurl
	  without the presence of libldap

	  lib/transfer.c, lib/url.c, lib/urldata.h, src/main.c,

	  bug report #1338648 (http://curl.haxx.se/bug/view.cgi?id=1338648)
	  which really is more of a feature request, but anyway. It pointed
	  out that --max-redirs did not allow it to be set to 0, which then
	  would return an error code on the first Location: found. Based on
	  Nis' patch, now libcurl supports CURLOPT_MAXREDIRS set to 0, or
	  -1 for infinity. Added test case 274 to verify.

	  upload binary data from stdin on Windows if the data contained

	  GnuTLS-enabled libcurl in bug report
	    #1334338 (http://curl.haxx.se/bug/view.cgi?id=1334338). When
	  reading an SSL
	    stream from a server and the server requests a "rehandshake",
	  the current
	    code simply returns this as an error. I have no good way to
	  test this, but
	    I've added a crude attempt of dealing with this situation
	  slightly better -
	    it makes a blocking handshake if this happens. Done like this
	  because fixing
	    this the "proper" way (that would handshake asynchronously)
	  will require
	    quite some work and I really need a good way to test this to do
	  such a
	    change.

	* lib/hostip6.c: Added a dump_addrinfo() function to ease debugging
	  of resolved names. Define DEBUG_ADDRINFO to enable.

2005-10-20 21:07  bagder

	* CHANGES, lib/Makefile.vc6: Temprimus improved the MSVC makefile:
	  "makes a build option available so if you set rtlibcfg=static for
	  the make, then it would build with /MT. The default behaviour is
	  /MD (the original)." http://curl.haxx.se/bug/view.cgi?id=1326665

2005-10-18 20:15  danf

	* docs/TODO: Removed mention of TFTP now that it's implemented.

2005-10-18 09:26  bagder

	* include/curl/multi.h: Mohun Biswas' suggested change to prevent
	  GNU indent to warn on the =-1 line.

2005-10-14 23:21  bagder

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES, maketgz, include/curl/curlver.h: Reverted
	  the LIBCURL_VERSION_NUM change from October 6. As Dave Dribin
	  reported, the define is used by the configure script and is
	  assumed to use the 0xYYXXZZ format. This made "curl-config
	  --vernum" fail in the 7.15.0 release version.

2005-10-14 15:22  bagder

	* lib/Makefile.vc6: Reported by 'TemPRImus' in bug 1326665: use the
	  "Multi-Threaded" options even when building the static library.
	  http://curl.haxx.se/bug/view.cgi?id=1326665

2005-10-13 23:49  bagder

	* docs/libcurl/curl_easy_setopt.3: Slight editing of wording in the
	  CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYHOST section.

2005-10-13 11:23  bagder

	* RELEASE-NOTES, include/curl/curlver.h: start working on 7.15.1

2005-10-13 11:22  bagder

	* docs/THANKS: added names from the 7.15.0 release

2005-10-13 10:19  bagder

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES: 7.15.0 time

2005-10-13 09:57  bagder

	* lib/http_ntlm.c: Make sure that the user and domain strings fit
	  in the target buffer before we copy them there.

2005-10-13 08:20  bagder

	* docs/libcurl/curl_easy_setopt.3: NTLM requires windows or
	  OpenSSL. If you build with GnuTLS for example you do not get NTLM
	  support enabled.

2005-10-11 14:54  bagder

	* TODO-RELEASE: 7.15.0 in november?

2005-10-10 22:58  bagder

	* docs/examples/getinmemory.c: make it compile warning-free and
	  free() the memory before exit

2005-10-10 20:28  bagder

	* lib/hostip6.c: pass a NULL pointer in the service argument (the
	  second) if the port number was 0 as it seems at least some AIX
	  versions don't like a "0" string there

2005-10-06 20:47  giva

	* lib/Makefile.Watcom: Added tftp.obj.

2005-10-06 14:56  bagder

	* RELEASE-NOTES, maketgz, include/curl/curlver.h: we all the next
	  version 7.15.0 due to the new TFTP support

2005-10-06 11:05  bagder

	* docs/libcurl/Makefile.am: remove getinfo-times from the dist
	  archive since the info is now in the curl_easy_getinfo man page

2005-10-06 11:03  bagder

	* docs/libcurl/curl_easy_getinfo.3: end the .nf section, mark the
	  option names properly so that they end up as links in the html
	  version

2005-10-06 10:58  bagder

	* docs/libcurl/curl_easy_getinfo.3: Added the info from
	  getinfo-times as it really belongs in this man page.

2005-10-05 11:15  bagder

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES: mention the recent fixes

2005-10-05 08:23  bagder

	* tests/data/: Makefile.am, test272: added test case 272 for -z
	  download over FTP when the timestamp is identical to the remote
	  one

2005-10-05 08:09  bagder

	* lib/ftp.c: CURL_TIMECOND_IFMODSINCE actually requires that the
	  remote document has been modded since the given time, so we
	  should compare <= and not just <.

2005-10-04 22:32  bagder

	* configure.ac: Domenico Andreoli's patch that removes a few
	  0xa0(!) bytes

2005-10-04 20:15  bagder

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES, lib/parsedate.c: Michael Wallner reported
	  that the date parser had wrong offset stored for the MEST and
	  CEST time zones.

2005-10-04 12:58  bagder

	* docs/libcurl/curl_escape.3: Domenico Andreoli's SEE ALSO patch

2005-10-03 12:12  bagder

	* ares/ares_getnameinfo.c: Ok, based on the online docs for AIX'es
	  getservbyport_r() I adjusted to code to do (what I believe is)
	  "right". See docs on:
	  http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/pseries/index.jsp?topic=/com.ibm.aix.doc/libs/commtrf2/getservbyport_r.htm

2005-10-03 10:38  bagder

	* docs/HISTORY: recent action

2005-10-02 20:22  giva

	* lib/http_ntlm.c: Avoid gcc warning "dereferencing type-punned
	  pointer will break strict-aliasing rules".

2005-10-02 18:52  giva

	* lib/: hostthre.c, setup.h: Fix for building with MS Visual-C and
	  single-threaded runtime libs.

2005-09-30 16:25  bagder

	* tests/runtests.pl: fixed the proper path to the tftpd server

2005-09-30 10:59  bagder

	* RELEASE-NOTES: a new mirror, but we don't increase the amount
	  since one of the former ones are now officially no longer
	  considered a mirror... ;-)

2005-09-30 10:34  bagder

	* docs/DISTRO-DILEMMA: Update in the "which license is best"
	  section as it seems Debian people have made up their mind.
	  Spell-checked as well.

2005-09-29 13:37  bagder

	* lib/url.c: Starting now, the verbose text that goes like "About
	  to connect() to" will now contain the word "proxy" is the
	  hostname is in fact a proxy. This will help users detect
	  situations when they mistakenly use a proxy.

2005-09-27 22:22  bagder

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES: David Yan brought the Content-Range
	  report

2005-09-27 11:13  bagder

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES, lib/transfer.c: An anonymous submitter
	  filed bug #1299181 (http://curl.haxx.se/bug/view.cgi?id=1299181)
	  that identified a silly problem with Content-Range: headers with
	  the 'bytes' keyword written in a different case than all
	  lowercase! It would cause a segfault!

2005-09-27 10:46  bagder

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES, lib/ftp.c: TJ Saunders of the proftpd
	  project identified and pointed out problems with the modified
	  FTPS negotiation change of August 19 2005. Thus, we revert the
	  change back to pre-7.14.1 status.

2005-09-22 12:15  bagder

	* docs/libcurl/curl_easy_setopt.3: clarify what the default read
	  callback does and how it uses the READDATA option

2005-09-21 13:29  bagder

	* CHANGES: three debian bug reports addressed

2005-09-21 13:28  bagder

	* lib/tftp.c: stricter type usage for time variables to avoid picky
	  compiler warnings

2005-09-21 12:45  bagder

	* ares/ares_getnameinfo.c: 1 - attempted fix of uninitialized
	  variable 2 - indented and edited to fit better within 80 columns
	  3 - fixed possible buffer overflow in the service name lookup
	  function

2005-09-21 11:10  bagder

	* ares/configure.ac: simplified the sin6_scope_id test and removed
	  some left-overs from the previous way of detecting it

2005-09-21 11:01  bagder

	* ares/configure.ac: fixed the check for the addrinfo struct

2005-09-21 08:59  bagder

	* docs/libcurl/curl_easy_setopt.3: clarified ERRORBUFFER - some
	  errors just don't write a string even though they should. And I
	  removed all uses 'Note' (as they are pretty useless) and did some
	  other language and phrasing cleanups.

2005-09-21 08:38  bagder

	* lib/transfer.c: return an error string for the missing URL case

2005-09-21 08:12  bagder

	* docs/libcurl/curl_easy_setopt.3: mention what WRITEFUNCTION and
	  WRITEDATA do by default

2005-09-21 08:07  bagder

	* docs/libcurl/libcurl-tutorial.3: oops, broken sentence fixed:
	  http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=329305

2005-09-20 10:29  bagder

	* lib/http_ntlm.c: Uses __stdcall instead of SEC_ENTRY since it
	  seems (at least) mingw doesn't define SEC_ENTRY and thus fails
	  unless this is done!

2005-09-20 09:53  bagder

	* configure.ac: Since newer ares versions should work with ipv6, I
	  modified the error message to a warning message as a first step.
	  We should persue to make curl use c-ares properly even when built
	  with ipv6 support.

2005-09-20 08:51  bagder

	* lib/tftp.c: typecasts added in an attempt to please the picky
	  compilers

2005-09-20 00:04  bagder

	* tests/data/Makefile.am: added test 271

2005-09-20 00:04  bagder

	* tests/data/test271: test 271, the first ever TFTP test

2005-09-20 00:03  bagder

	* tests/server/tftpd.c: seems to work for test 271 on Linux now!

2005-09-19 23:45  bagder

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES, lib/http_ntlm.c: Dmitry Bartsevich made
	  the SSPI support work on Windows 9x as well

2005-09-18 18:44  dmeglio

	* ares/: CHANGES, acinclude.m4, ares.h, ares_getnameinfo.c,
	  configure.ac: Added constants that will be used by
	  ares_getaddrinfo. Made ares_getnameinfo use the reentrant
	  getservbyport (getservbyport_r) if it isavailable to ensure it
	  works properly in a threaded environment

2005-09-16 23:30  bagder

	* lib/: connect.c, ftp.c, hostip4.c, hostip6.c, hostthre.c, url.c,
	  urldata.h: keep 'socktype' in the connectdata struct and make
	  sure we use that for all protocol sockets even if the resolved
	  address may say otherwise

2005-09-16 23:03  bagder

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES: recent changes

2005-09-16 12:52  bagder

	* tests/server/tftpd.c: renamed sendfile() since some systems have
	  a system call named like this - now the functions are named
	  sendtftp() and recvtftp() instead.

2005-09-16 12:50  bagder

	* tests/server/tftpd.c: In the Solaris 7 header files for tftp, the
	  th_stuff struct member is an unsigned short. Trying a typecast
	  here to fix.

2005-09-16 09:19  bagder

	* tests/server/tftpd.c: prevent warnings on re-defining MIN

2005-09-16 09:18  bagder

	* CHANGES, docs/TODO: added URLs to bug reports

2005-09-16 09:09  bagder

	* docs/KNOWN_BUGS: Added known bugs #26, started using my new
	  "bounce URL" that jumps to the correct (and overly complicated)
	  sourceforge bug tracker URL given the bug report ID number.

2005-09-16 08:14  bagder

	* tests/server/tftpd.c: use int "subscripts" to prevent warnings
	  from picky compilers

2005-09-16 07:49  bagder

	* tests/server/tftpd.c: use internal *printf() clones

2005-09-15 23:50  bagder

	* configure.ac, tests/server/tftpd.c: ifdef for includes, added
	  checking for two not previously checked files (one being
	  necessary for solaris builds)

2005-09-15 23:49  bagder

	* tests/testcurl.pl: use make -k when running the tests

2005-09-15 22:36  bagder

	* tests/server/.cvsignore: ignore this too

2005-09-15 22:36  bagder

	* tests/server/Makefile.am: build tftpd too!

2005-09-15 22:32  bagder

	* tests/server/tftpd.c: First version of the TFTP server. Basic
	  functionality is there.

2005-09-15 22:25  bagder

	* tests/runtests.pl: added TFTP and TFTP-ipv6 support

2005-09-15 22:22  bagder

	* tests/server/: sws.c, util.c, util.h: moved test2file() to util.c

2005-09-15 22:21  bagder

	* lib/tftp.c: minor changes, the biggest one being using
	  Curl_select()

2005-09-15 21:23  bagder

	* ares/CHANGES: mention the configure change

2005-09-14 17:04  bagder

	* lib/ftp.c: oops, return error if an error did occur!

2005-09-12 22:36  bagder

	* docs/libcurl/curl_easy_setopt.3: CURLOPT_BUFFERSIZE clarification

2005-09-10 23:09  bagder

	* ares/: acinclude.m4, configure.ac: Use the AC_CHECK_MEMBER()
	  function for check struct members instead of inventing and
	  providing our own. Hopefully this solves a HP-UX 11.00 problem.

2005-09-08 22:21  bagder

	* docs/curl.1: --max-time should work just as good on win32 these
	  days

2005-09-08 08:16  bagder

	* docs/curl.1: mention the protocol-guessing when no protocol part
	  is given in the URL added TFTP to the list of supported protocols

2005-09-07 16:42  bagder

	* lib/Makefile.vc6: added tftp.c

2005-09-07 13:05  bagder

	* src/main.c: Ben Madsen reported a problem that only seemed to
	  occur with certain specific glibc versions, and with this patch
	  applied it no longer shows up to me. The problem was indeed a
	  flaw that made curl use a file handle already closed.

2005-09-07 12:51  bagder

	* tests/server/sws.c: Thanks to Scott Davis' detailed reports, I
	  found this premature detection of the end of a chunked-encoded
	  POST request.

2005-09-06 17:58  giva

	* lib/hostthre.c: Fix warning about missing initializers.

2005-09-06 17:43  giva

	* lib/tftp.c: Fix for bind() on Winsock; AF_UNSPEC (0) is illegal.
	  Should we do this for all targets?

2005-09-06 15:27  bagder

	* CHANGES, src/writeout.c: Now curl warns if an unknown variable is
	  used in the -w/--writeout argument.

2005-09-06 13:53  bagder

	* RELEASE-NOTES, docs/BINDINGS: binding updates

2005-09-06 12:39  bagder

	* lib/tftp.c: sockets are curl_socket_t to build cleaner

2005-09-06 12:37  bagder

	* lib/hostthre.c: Use SOCK_DGRAM for TFTP. Consider setting this up
	  at one central place, we have this check done on far too many
	  places by now...

2005-09-06 02:39  gknauf

	* lib/Makefile.netware, src/Makefile.netware: minor Makefile fixes.

2005-09-05 16:22  bagder

	* docs/THANKS: Added the people from the 7.14.1 release
	  announcement.

2005-09-05 08:03  bagder

	* docs/DISTRO-DILEMMA: new release, work has been "initiated"

2005-09-05 00:10  bagder

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES: mention the recent improvements

2005-09-04 23:53  bagder

	* docs/curl.1: don't start lines with apostrophes!

2005-09-04 20:33  bagder

	* lib/tftp.c: check that bind() returns success

2005-09-04 20:15  bagder

	* curl-config.in: --protocols now supports TFTP

2005-09-04 07:23  bagder

	* docs/curl.1, docs/libcurl/curl_easy_setopt.3, src/main.c: 7.14.2
	  actually

2005-09-04 07:16  bagder

	* docs/curl.1, docs/libcurl/curl_easy_setopt.3,
	  include/curl/curl.h, lib/ftp.c, lib/url.c, lib/urldata.h,
	  src/main.c, tests/FILEFORMAT, tests/ftpserver.pl,
	  tests/data/Makefile.am, tests/data/test270: Added
	  FTP_SKIP_PASV_IP and --ftp-skip-pasv-ip

2005-09-02 17:11  bagder

	* CHANGES, configure.ac, include/curl/curl.h, lib/Makefile.inc,
	  lib/connect.c, lib/hostip4.c, lib/hostip6.c, lib/strerror.c,
	  lib/tftp.c, lib/tftp.h, lib/url.c, lib/urldata.h, lib/version.c:
	  John Kelly added TFTP support to libcurl. A bunch of new error
	  codes was added. TODO: add them to docs. add TFTP server to test
	  suite. add TFTP to list of protocols whereever those are
	  mentioned.

2005-09-02 15:40  bagder

	* docs/DISTRO-DILEMMA: explain why the ABI depends on the SSL libs

2005-09-01 23:41  bagder

	* buildconf: use -c to automake to copy the new files

2005-09-01 23:08  bagder

	* RELEASE-NOTES, include/curl/curlver.h: work on 7.14.2 starts now

2005-09-01 22:54  bagder

	* CHANGES: 7.14.1 coming right up

2005-09-01 17:03  bagder

	* docs/DISTRO-DILEMMA: softened my opinions, added API benefit -
	  Thanks to Eric Cooper

2005-09-01 15:41  bagder

	* docs/libcurl/curl_easy_setopt.3: clarify that the ctxfunc is
	  called on all new connects

2005-09-01 10:44  bagder

	* docs/Makefile.am: added DISTRO-DILEMMA

2005-09-01 10:43  bagder

	* docs/DISTRO-DILEMMA: added the URL

2005-09-01 10:35  bagder

	* docs/DISTRO-DILEMMA: new

2005-08-31 23:23  bagder

	* configure.ac: oops, the GNU GSS patch could clobber the CPPFLAGS
	  variable and it thus broke krb4 builds!

2005-08-31 22:51  bagder

	* RELEASE-NOTES: ocurl release

2005-08-31 08:04  bagder

	* lib/hostthre.c: use it as 'struct addrinfo' so perhaps it builds
	  on mingw again

2005-08-30 20:37  gknauf

	* tests/testcurl.pl: quick hack to make it working again on Win32 -
	  however we should consider to set some defaults depending on the
	  compiler architecture we guess we are since it doesnt work well
	  if we prefer building the msvc makefile with gmake instead of
	  nmake because we found gmake first in path....

2005-08-29 23:04  bagder

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES: Kevin Lussier pointed out a problem with
	  curllib.dsp

2005-08-29 22:56  bagder

	* lib/msvcproj.head: Use the more correct BUILDING_LIBCURL define
	  instead of CURLLIB_EXPORTS.  Kevin Lussier pointed this out!

2005-08-29 17:19  bagder

	* RELEASE-NOTES: spell-fix

2005-08-29 16:23  bagder

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES, lib/hostthre.c: Igor Polyakov fixed a
	  rather nasty problem with the threaded name resolver for Windows,
	  that could lead to an Access Violation when the multi interface
	  was used due to an issue with how the resolver thread was and was
	  not terminated.

2005-08-29 15:58  bagder

	* docs/LICENSE-MIXING: Added GNU GSS and separate sections for MIT
	  GSS and Heimdal and added info about what each single lib may be
	  used for.

2005-08-29 10:42  bagder

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES, configure.ac, lib/urldata.h: Simon
	  Josefson brought GNU GSS support

2005-08-29 09:03  bagder

	* ares/CHANGES: 1.3.0 coming just up

2005-08-29 08:59  bagder

	* docs/TODO, lib/TODO.gnutls: Moved the GnuTLS related TODO items
	  from lib/TODO.gnutls to the proper docs/TODO

2005-08-26 15:22  bagder

	* docs/FAQ: 4.14 Redirects work in browser but not with curl!

2005-08-25 14:19  bagder

	* docs/curl.1: ok, the right term (using RFC2616 lingo) for the -X
	  keyword is method and not request

2005-08-25 09:06  bagder

	* docs/libcurl/curl_easy_setopt.3: "Added in 7.14.1" notes and some
	  minor edits

2005-08-25 09:06  bagder

	* docs/libcurl/curl_easy_getinfo.3: CURLINFO_COOKIELIST is added in
	  7.14.1

2005-08-24 19:07  bagder

	* docs/examples/: Makefile.am, cacertinmem.c: Theo Borm's example,
	  as was posted here:
	  http://curl.haxx.se/mail/lib-2005-08/0163.html

2005-08-24 12:57  bagder

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES, docs/curl.1,
	  docs/libcurl/curl_easy_setopt.3, include/curl/curl.h,
	  lib/transfer.c, lib/url.c, lib/urldata.h, src/main.c,
	  tests/data/Makefile.am, tests/data/test269: Toby Peterson added
	  CURLOPT_IGNORE_CONTENT_LENGTH to the library, accessible from the
	  command line tool with --ignore-content-length. This will make it
	  easier to download files from Apache 1.x (and similar) servers
	  that are still having problems serving files larger than 2 or 4
	  GB. When this option is enabled, curl will simply have to wait
	  for the server to close the connection to signal end of transfer.
	  I wrote test case 269 that runs a simple test that this works.

2005-08-24 12:49  bagder

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES, tests/runtests.pl: valgrind version 3
	  renames the --logfile command line option to --log-file...

2005-08-24 09:45  bagder

	* docs/KNOWN_BUGS: fixed #26, GnuTLS CA cert verification

2005-08-24 09:40  bagder

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES, lib/gtls.c: Fixed CA cert verification
	  using GnuTLS with the default bundle, which previously failed due
	  to GnuTLS not allowing x509 v1 CA certs by default.

2005-08-23 10:51  bagder

	* docs/KNOWN_BUGS: known bug #26, pretty fatal for anyone who wants
	  to use proper SSL and GnuTLS

2005-08-22 04:39  gknauf

	* lib/Makefile.netware, src/Makefile.netware: enabled statically
	  linked builds.

	* acinclude.m4: removed the unreachable code warning from gcc debug
	  builds, even the most recent gcc versions give far too many false

2005-08-19 16:41  bagder

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES, lib/ftp.c: Norbert Novotny had problems
	  with FTPS and he helped me work out a patch that made curl run
	  fine in his end. The key was to make sure we do the SSL/TLS
	  negotiation immediately after the TCP connect is done and not
	  after a few other commands have been sent like we did previously.
	  I don't consider this change necessary to obey the standards, I
	  think this server is pickier than what the specs allow it to be,
	  but I can't see how this modified libcurl code can add any
	  problems to those who are interpreting the standards more
	  liberally.

	* RELEASE-NOTES: handles expiry times in cookie files that go
	  beyond 32 bits in size

2005-08-17 10:55  bagder

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES, lib/cookie.c, lib/cookie.h,
	  lib/transfer.c, lib/url.c: - Jeff Pohlmeyer found out that if you
	  ask libcurl to load a cookiefile (with   CURLOPT_COOKIEFILE), add
	  a cookie (with CURLOPT_COOKIELIST), tell it to   write the result
	  to a given cookie jar and then never actually call
	  curl_easy_perform() - the given file(s) to read was never read
	  but the   output file was written and thus it caused a "funny"
	  result.

	  - While doing some tests for the bug above, I noticed that
	  Firefox generates   large numbers (for the expire time) in the
	  cookies.txt file and libcurl	 didn't treat them properly. Now it
	  does.

2005-08-16 22:12  gknauf

	* lib/libcurl.def: added curl_mvsnprintf to the export list; I
	  appened to the end cause of the numbering ...

2005-08-15 23:48  bagder

	* src/main.c: Added more verbose "warning" messages to the curl
	  client for cases where it fails to open/read files etc to help
	  users diagnose why it doesn't do what you'd expect it to.
	  Converted lots of old messages to use the new generic function I
	  wrote for this purpose.

2005-08-13 23:28  bagder

	* lib/transfer.c: James Bursa identified a libcurl HTTP bug and a
	  good way to repeat it. If a site responds with bad HTTP response
	  that doesn't contain any header at all, only a response body, and
	  the write callback returns 0 to abort the transfer, it didn't
	  have any real effect but the write callback would be called once
	  more anyway.

2005-08-13 00:09  bagder

	* tests/data/: Makefile.am, test268: added test 268 that makes curl
	  -d @nonexisting

2005-08-12 23:47  bagder

	* docs/libcurl/curl_getdate.3: clarify

2005-08-12 23:25  bagder

	* src/main.c: o curl -d @filename when 'filename' was not possible
	  to access no longer	converts the request to a GET, but now
	  instead makes it a POST of no data o The time condition illegal
	  syntax warning is now inhibited if -s is used.

	  make on Win32.

2005-08-09 23:59  bagder

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES, lib/parsedate.c: Christopher R. Palmer
	  fixed the offsets used for date parsings when the time zone name
	  of a daylight savings time was used. For example, PDT vs PDS.
	  This flaw was introduced with the new date parser (11 sep 2004 -
	  7.12.2).  Fortunately, no web server or cookie string etc should
	  be using such time zone names thus limiting the effect of this
	  bug.

2005-08-09 01:09  bagder

	* TODO-RELEASE: mention two other bugs we should fix before release

2005-08-08 00:59  bagder

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES, lib/url.c: Jon Grubbs filed bug report
	  #1249962 which identified a problem with NTLM on a HTTP proxy if
	  an FTP URL was given. libcurl now properly switches to pure HTTP
	  internally when an HTTP proxy is used, even for FTP URLs. The
	  problem would also occur with other multi-pass auth methods.

2005-08-07 23:45  bagder

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES, curl-config.in: When curl is built with
	  GnuTLS, curl-config didn't include "SSL" when --features was used

2005-08-07 23:39  bagder

	  cannot know if it works or not!

2005-08-07 16:36  bagder

	* docs/FAQ: mention our security related mail alias in the "who do
	  I mail" section

2005-08-05 01:05  bagder

	* tests/memanalyze.pl: Support realloc() on a NULL pointer properly

	  previous commit)

2005-07-28 23:51  bagder

	* docs/examples/cookie_interface.c: fixed example since this is how
	  the interface works now

2005-07-28 23:50  bagder

	* lib/url.c: now strdups the cookielist inpointer before passed on,
	  as the cookie function modifies it

2005-07-28 23:49  bagder

	* lib/cookie.c: curl standard indent/format

2005-07-28 15:20  giva

2005-07-28 00:29  bagder

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES, docs/libcurl/curl_easy_setopt.3,
	  lib/url.c: If any of the options CURLOPT_HTTPGET, CURLOPT_POST

	  lib/cookie.c, lib/cookie.h, lib/getinfo.c, lib/url.c: Peteris
	  Krumins added CURLOPT_COOKIELIST and CURLINFO_COOKIELIST, which
	  is a simple interface to extracting and setting cookies in
	  libcurl's internal "cookie jar". See the new cookie_interface.c
	  example code.

2005-07-27 23:44  bagder

	* lib/http_ntlm.h: disabling HTTP should also nullify this function
	  call

2005-07-22 00:18  danf

	  --without-gssapi --without-krb4

2005-07-20 23:58  danf

2005-07-17 14:44  bagder

	* lib/: easy.c, url.c, url.h: Simplified the code within

	  using the header callback

2005-07-13 09:44  bagder

	  header callback/stream.

2005-07-08 15:28  bagder

2005-07-05 20:07  giva

	* lib/libcurl.rc: Update copyright.

2005-07-05 16:57  bagder

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES, lib/parsedate.c: Gisle Vanem came up with
	  a nice little work-around for bug #1230118. It seems the Windows
	  (MSVC) libc time functions may return data one hour off if TZ is
	  not set and automatic DST adjustment is enabled. This made
	  curl_getdate() return wrong value, and it also concerned internal
	  cookie expirations etc.

2005-07-04 23:53  bagder

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES: mention the strerror_r detection fix in
	  configure

2005-07-04 00:25  bagder

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES, lib/ftp.c, lib/http.c, lib/http.h,
	  tests/runtests.pl, tests/data/Makefile.am, tests/data/test265:
	  Andrew Bushnell provided enough info for me to tell that we badly
	  needed to fix the CONNECT authentication code with multi-pass
	  auth methods (such as NTLM) as it didn't previously properly
	  ignore response-bodies - in fact it stopped reading after all
	  response headers had been received. This could lead to libcurl
	  sending the next request and reading the body from the first
	  request as response to the second request. (I also renamed the
	  function, which wasn't strictly necessary but...)

	  The best fix would to once and for all make the CONNECT code use
	  the ordinary request sending/receiving code, treating it as any
	  ordinary request instead of the special-purpose function we have
	  now. It should make it better for multi-interface too. And
	  possibly lead to less code...

	  Added test case 265 for this. It doesn't work as a _really_ good
	  test case since the test proxy is too stupid, but the test case
	  helps when running the debugger to verify.

2005-06-30 16:07  bagder

	* tests/memanalyze.pl: add more info when this script gets
	  confused, and added getaddrinfo and freeaddrinfo to the trace
	  output

2005-06-30 15:30  bagder

	* lib/memdebug.c: use %p to printf pointers since %x doesn't work
	  properly on tru64 for this (and besides, we should be using the
	  same %-code for all pointers)

2005-06-30 15:28  bagder

	* lib/memdebug.h: enable memory debugging on tru64 with ipv6
	  support by doing a little different defining, since the system
	  headers themselves redefine getaddrinfo

2005-06-30 06:53  danf

	* acinclude.m4: Detect (or at least infer) glibc-style strerror_r
	  even when cross-compiling.

	* tests/data/test264: verify that the URL decoding is done properly
	  too

2005-06-23 00:24  bagder

	* lib/url.c, tests/data/Makefile.am, tests/data/test264: David
	  Shaw's fix that unifies proxy string treatment so that a proxy
	  given with CURLOPT_PROXY can use a http:// prefix and user +
	  password. The user and password fields are now also URL decoded
	  properly.

	  Test case 264 added to verify.

2005-06-22 08:58  bagder

	* docs/libcurl/libcurl.m4: David Shaw's updated version:

	  It now properly handles code that uses curl_free() (since not all
	  versions of curl have it), and also fixes a few problems when
	  detecting libcurl on MinGW, and a linker problem on OSX Panther.

2005-06-06 23:19  bagder

	* CHANGES, buildconf, docs/libcurl/Makefile.am: Tupone Alfredo's
	  fixes:

	  1) findtool does look per tool in PATH and think ./perl is the
	  perl executable, while is just a local directory (I have . in the
	  PATH)

	  2) I got several warning for head -1 deprecated in favour of head
	  -n 1

	  3) ares directory is missing some file (missing is missing :-) )
	  because automake and friends is not run.

	  (Let's hope number 2 doesn't break somewhere "out there", if so
	  we can always search/replace that back.)

	    read_udp_packets(), though maybe it should. (This patch was
	  edited by Daniel
	    Stenberg and a new configure test was added (imported from
	  curl's configure)
	    to properly detect what non-blocking socket approach to use.)

	* ares/: CHANGES, ares_expand_name.c: William Ahern:

	    I'm not quite sure how this was happening, but I've been seeing
	  PTR queries
	    which seem to return empty responses. At least, they were empty
	  when calling
	    ares_expand_name() on the record. Here's a patch which
	  guarantees to
	    NUL-terminate the expanded name. The old behavior failed to
	  NUL-terminate if
	    len was 0, and this was causing strlen() to run past the end of
	  the buffer
	    after calling ares_expand_name() and getting ARES_SUCCESS as
	  the return
	    value. If q is not greater than *s then it's equal and *s is
	  always
	    allocated with at least one byte.

	* configure.ac: specify the cares lib before the other libs, to
	  make it build fine with mingw - inspired by Tupone Alfredo's bug
	  report (and patch) #1212940

2005-05-31 15:03  bagder

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES, lib/url.c, tests/data/Makefile.am,
	  tests/data/test263: Todd Kulesza reported a flaw in the proxy
	  option, since a numerical IPv6 address was not possible to use.
	  It is now, but requires it written RFC2732-style, within brackets
	  - which incidently is how you enter numerical IPv6 addresses in
	  URLs. Test case 263 added to verify.

2005-05-31 14:57  bagder

	* tests/data/: test240, test241, test242, test243: added keywords

2005-05-30 00:38  bagder

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES: recent changes

2005-05-30 00:30  bagder

	* CHANGES, lib/transfer.c, tests/data/Makefile.am,
	  tests/data/test262: Eric Cooper reported about a problem with
	  HTTP servers that responds with binary zeroes within the headers.
	  They confused libcurl to do wrong so the downloaded headers
	  become incomplete. The fix is now verified with test case 262.

2005-05-27 13:39  bagder

	* lib/hostip4.c: avoid the sensitive word as it looks bad in some
	  people's eyes

2005-05-27 13:01  bagder

	* tests/libtest/lib505.c: Andrs Garca fixed a warning appearing
	  on windows

2005-05-26 22:56  bagder

	* lib/: inet_ntoa_r.h, inet_ntop.c: provide the proper copyright
	  texts for these

2005-05-26 00:14  bagder

	* configure.ac: set LD_LIBRARY_PATH properly even when the openssl
	  lib dir is found using pkg-config

2005-05-26 00:12  bagder

	* tests/server/sockfilt.c: silense a warning

2005-05-25 15:07  bagder

	  killing

2005-05-25 14:04  bagder

	  output to stderr if the logfile can't be opened

2005-05-25 14:04  bagder

	* tests/server/sockfilt.c: nicer raw logging and put code into
	  (nicer) functions

2005-05-24 23:09  bagder

	* tests/ftpserver.pl: don't restart sockfilt after only 5 seconds
	  of inactivity

2005-05-24 23:02  bagder

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES: recent action

2005-05-24 12:03  bagder

	* tests/data/: test171, test46, test517, test523, test61, test73:
	  Andres Garcia's mode=text patch to make these do fine on Windows

2005-05-24 11:40  bagder

	* tests/data/: Makefile.am, test261: add test case 261, response
	  code 226 to TYPE

2005-05-24 11:39  bagder

	* lib/ftp.c: Now allow TYPE responses to be any 2xx code, and log
	  if it isn't 200.

2005-05-22 19:54  bagder

	* configure.ac: removed leftover debug message ("moo moo")

2005-05-22 00:38  bagder

	* tests/data/: test220, test221, test222, test223, test224,

	* tests/server/sws.c: include ctype.h for isdigit()

2005-05-19 09:21  bagder

	* RELEASE-NOTES: three fixes since 7.14.0

2005-05-18 22:01  bagder

	* lib/url.c, tests/data/Makefile.am, tests/data/test260,
	  tests/server/sws.c: Bug report #1204435 identified a problem with
	  malformed URLs like "http://somehost?data" as it added a slash
	  too much in the request ("GET /?data/"...). Added test case 260
	  to verify.

2005-05-18 22:00  bagder

	* CHANGES: update

2005-05-18 17:15  bagder

	* acinclude.m4: adjusted the strerror_r test more, use _REENTRANT
	  instead of _THREAD_SAFE when looking for the prototype

2005-05-18 15:24  bagder

	* CHANGES, acinclude.m4, lib/strerror.c: The configure check for
	  strerror_r() failed to detect the proper API at times, like on my
	  HP-UX 10.20 tests. And then lib/strerror.c badly assumed the
	  glibc version if the posix define wasn't set (since it _had_
	  found a strerror_r).

2005-05-18 12:38  bagder

	* docs/KNOWN_BUGS: #15 is now fixed

2005-05-18 12:14  bagder

	* docs/FEATURES: clarified for GnuTLS

	* README: removed the separate table with download links, and
	  extended the curl site list with all current mirrors

2005-05-17 14:07  bagder

	* tests/testcurl.pl: scan for gmake and make to prefer gmake on
	  systems that have it

2005-05-17 12:27  bagder

	* tests/: runtests.pl, data/test241, server/resolve.c: Made test
	  case 241 precheck that the given name resolves to an ipv6
	  address, or the test is skipped. Ideally, we should let this test
	  case go over a few frequently used IPv6 localhost aliases...

2005-05-17 12:22  bagder

	* tests/server/: Makefile.am, resolve.c, sockfilt.c, sws.c, util.c,
	  util.h: Moved more generic functions to util.[ch] Added resolve.c
	  to simply resolve a given host name

2005-05-17 11:18  bagder

	* lib/ftp.c: check if getsockname() returns failure before using
	  the address it provides

	* ares/ares_getnameinfo.c: Cleaned up some compile warnings

2005-05-16 20:06  dmeglio

	* ares/: CHANGES, Makefile.inc, acinclude.m4, ares.h,
	  ares_getnameinfo.3, ares_getnameinfo.c, ares_ipv6.h,
	  ares_strerror.c, configure.ac, setup.h: Added ares_getnameinfo
	  which mimics the getnameinfo API

2005-05-16 17:09  bagder

	* configure.ac: Modified the gmtime_r check to not check for it
	  until the "check for a working one" is made, and only if that
	  test runs ok we define it as present. Unless crosscompiling,
	  since then we use the former AC_CHECK_FUNCS method.

2005-05-16 16:53  bagder

	* configure.ac: define GMTIME_R to 0 if not working

2005-05-16 16:40  bagder

	* tests/runtests.pl: return, not exit, on several places

2005-05-15 18:31  dmeglio

	* ares/inet_ntop.c: Converted some macros to use NS_* so they work
	  on non-IPv6 systems

2005-05-15 06:38  dmeglio

	* ares/inet_ntop.c: Forgot to ares_-ize inet_ntop

2005-05-14 23:15  bagder

	* lib/connect.c: fix warning about redefined symbol

2005-05-14 22:45  bagder

2005-05-14 08:04  giva

	* lib/makefile.dj: Updated generated dependencies.

2005-05-14 08:00  giva

	* lib/: ftp.c, url.c: Some patches for (a stricter/smarter) gcc 4.0
	  and warnings like:   'x' may be used uninitialized in this
	  function.

2005-05-14 07:59  giva

	* lib/config.dj: 'ssize_t' seems to be a gcc 4.x built-in.

2005-05-14 07:58  giva

	* lib/connect.c: Change for systems with >1 ways of setting
	  (non-)blocking mode. (djgpp/Watt-32 has 3 ways). Should rewrite
	  this using "#elif ..", but maybe there is still broken cpp
	  around?

2005-05-14 01:00  bagder

	* docs/VERSIONS: updated

2005-05-14 00:24  bagder

	  C) CONNECT HTTP request over proxy:

	   - "Host: [name]:[port]"
	   - "Proxy-Connection: Keep-alive"

	* ares/ares_ipv6.h: prevent NS_IN6ADDRSZ from getting set to zero
	  if the struct doesn't exist

2005-05-11 01:02  bagder

	* lib/transfer.c: Hm, this doesn't feel right. The error bits
	  returned from Curl_select() can be returned at times when we want
	  to ignore them. Test case 160 fails on Linux, so I modify the
	  comparison to check for _only_ the error bit set...

2005-05-11 00:48  bagder

	* lib/transfer.c: me stupid, errno is not set for mere
	  select()-exceptions

2005-05-11 00:46  bagder

	* lib/transfer.c: include protos to fix warnings

2005-05-11 00:44  bagder

	* lib/transfer.c: If Curl_select() returns with the error bit set,
	  bail out.

2005-05-10 13:21  bagder

	* tests/server/sockfilt.c: prevent 64bit warnings

2005-05-10 13:19  bagder

	* docs/THANKS: updated with the current RELEASE-NOTES names

2005-05-09 11:11  bagder

	* docs/THANKS: I decided to make this list more complete. I took
	  the 5-year anniversary list from 2003 and added all names from
	  all release notes in the CVS (there is a slight gap though). I
	  removed names with only first names (Like "Chris" and "Ralph") ,
	  as that won't make anyone happy and we might list their full
	  names as well anyway.

	  This list is now intended to include _all_ people that
	  contribute: big or small. 389 names at the time of this commit.

2005-05-09 09:45  bagder

2005-05-07 15:57  bagder

	* lib/: ftp.c, setup.h: DEBUGF() is a new conveniant macro to add
	  infof() calls (or similar) for debug builds only. Made the ftp
	  code use it on several places.

2005-05-07 15:52  bagder

	* tests/server/sockfilt.c: Added an active disconnected state, to
	  make the code clearer.

2005-05-07 10:55  bagder

	* tests/server/sockfilt.c: removed unnecessary logging to ease REAL
	  debuggin

2005-05-07 01:46  bagder

	* RELEASE-NOTES: one more command line option, fixed the AIX 4.3
	  enabled IPv6 build (it now detects a bad Ipv6 situation and
	  disables it automatically)

2005-05-07 01:22  bagder

	* tests/data/: Makefile.am, test258, test259: Added two test cases
	  for multipart formpost over a proxy with --anyauth. Our HTTP test
	  server is a bit limited though, as it never responds to the POST
	  request until all data has been sent (and received)...

2005-05-07 01:21  bagder

	* tests/runtests.pl: When a server is clearly running, curl is now
	  invoked to verify that it can download a file from the server
	  before the server is considered fine to use for the given test
	  case. This should fix the cases where the server can run but curl
	  cannot work with it.

2005-05-05 08:04  bagder

	* lib/sslgen.c: use calloc instead of malloc to save a call to
	  memset()

2005-05-04 23:58  bagder

	* tests/runtests.pl: now add --trace-time by default for curl tests

2005-05-04 23:57  bagder

	* tests/ftpserver.pl: removed lots of (now) redundant logging

2005-05-04 23:51  bagder

	* tests/ftpserver.pl: modify a value we are allowed to

2005-05-04 23:49  bagder

	* tests/ftpserver.pl: improved logging (all FTP protocol data, both
	  ways) to possibly help us realize why sometimes the control
	  connection dies after a RETR has been sent

2005-05-04 17:11  bagder

	* TODO-RELEASE: towards 7.14.0 - really

2005-05-04 16:52  bagder

	* lib/sslgen.c: prevent memory leak when built SSL disabled

2005-05-04 01:14  bagder

	* tests/runtests.pl: *MAN* was this hard to track down. Had I just
	  read the docs properly from the start... Anyway, fork() + exec()
	  makes _two_ pids (in perl) that we need to track and kill after
	  use. Thankyouverymuch.

2005-05-04 01:13  bagder

	* tests/ftpserver.pl: add more info to the log to ease debugging

2005-05-03 00:53  bagder

	* lib/: connect.c, ftp.c: improved failf() error messages

2005-05-03 00:33  bagder

	* ares/ares_version.h: the new functions and the upcoming ipv6
	  calls for the next version to become 1.3.0

2005-05-02 16:33  bagder

	* src/: homedir.c, setup.h: corrected copyright years

2005-05-02 16:33  bagder

	* lib/: formdata.c, md5.c, netrc.c: corrected copyright year

2005-05-02 16:06  bagder

	* CHANGES, acinclude.m4, docs/KNOWN_BUGS: Sort of "fixed"
	  KNOWN_BUGS #4: curl now builds IPv6 enabled on AIX 4.3. At least
	  it should no longer cause a compiler error. However, it does not
	  have AI_NUMERICHOST so we cannot getaddrinfo() any numerical
	  addresses with it (we use that for FTP PORT/EPRT)! So, I modified
	  the configure check that checks if the getaddrinfo() is working,
	  to use AI_NUMERICHOST since then it'll fail on AIX 4.3 and it
	  will automatically build with IPv6 support disabled.

2005-05-02 13:56  bagder

	* acinclude.m4, configure.ac, lib/ftp.c: Now configure checks for
	  struct sockaddr_storage and the ftp code tries to survive without
	  it if not found. AIX 4.3 targetted adjustment.

2005-05-02 13:55  bagder

	* tests/ftpserver.pl: another <case> converted to sysread

2005-05-02 13:31  bagder

	* tests/ftpserver.pl: read from the open2 filehandle with sysread,
	  not <handle>

2005-05-02 12:22  bagder

	* tests/: ftpserver.pl, runtests.pl: Fixed the FTP server read
	  stuff when waiting for a connect after a PASV/EPSV.

	  Made the ftp server use the passed in pidfile name, and made
	  runtests.pl pass it in properly.

2005-05-02 12:03  bagder

	* tests/ftpserver.pl: fix the server for the slow response case

2005-05-02 11:38  bagder

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES, docs/curl.1, src/main.c: Added
	  --trace-time that when used adds a time stamp to each trace line
	  that --trace, --trace-ascii and --verbose output. I also made the
	  '>' display separate each line on the linefeed so that HTTP
	  requests etc look nicer in the -v output.

2005-05-02 11:08  bagder

	* tests/runtests.pl: When starting the ftp server, wait a few
	  seconds to make really sure that a pidfile for the server appears
	  as otherwise it failed.

2005-05-02 11:08  bagder

	* tests/ftpserver.pl: Make sure there's no pidfile if we cannot
	  start the initial sockfilt tool - this happens for some
	  ipv6-enabled hosts on which sockfilt cannot listen on ipv6.

2005-05-02 10:40  bagder

	* CHANGES: two bugfixes, one change and one test script
	  modification

2005-05-02 09:59  bagder

	* RELEASE-NOTES: two bugs, one change

2005-05-02 09:54  bagder

	* tests/runtests.pl: blank a few more environment variables before
	  running a test

2005-05-02 09:53  bagder

	* src/main.c: Made curl recognize the environment variables Lynx
	  (and others?) support for pointing out the CA cert path/file:
	  SSL_CERT_DIR and SSL_CERT_FILE. If CURL_CA_BUNDLE is not set,
	  they are checked afterwards.

2005-05-02 09:28  bagder

	* docs/libcurl/curl_easy_setopt.3: Bryan Henderson's fine update of
	  SSL_VERIFYPEER and SSL_VERIFYHOST

2005-05-02 01:16  bagder

	* src/main.c: prevent two compiler warnings on comparisons between
	  signed and unsigned

2005-05-01 15:20  bagder

	* tests/runtests.pl: fixed to use fork()+exec() to start test
	  servers

2005-05-01 14:56  bagder

	* tests/server/: sockfilt.c, sws.c, util.c: always use the
	  libcurl-provided *printf() functions

2005-05-01 14:51  bagder

	* tests/server/Makefile.am: util.h added as "source" to make it get
	  added in dist archives

2005-05-01 01:35  bagder

	* tests/server/util.c: logfile name is const

2005-05-01 01:30  bagder

	* tests/server/: Makefile.am, sockfilt.c, sws.c, util.c, util.h:
	  Moved common code to util.[ch] instead of having it duplicated in
	  sws.c and sockfilt.c. For good-to-have functions for the servers
	  written in C.

2005-05-01 01:07  bagder

	* lib/transfer.c: there cannot be chunked problem when no_body
	  (HEAD) is true since without body there is nothing
	  chunked-encoded!

2005-04-30 17:16  bagder

	* lib/connect.c: singleipconnect() returns a socket descriptor, not
	  a CURLcode (but perhaps we should make it do that...)

2005-04-29 14:34  bagder

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES: more fixes

2005-04-28 23:26  bagder

	* docs/curl.1: Updated with (new and old) default config file
	  search path explanation.

2005-04-28 23:07  bagder

	* tests/data/test31: Set mode text on the section that is written
	  by curl in text mode, to allow the runtests.pl to check this
	  differently on operating systems that differentiate on this.

2005-04-28 23:06  bagder

	* tests/ftpserver.pl: basic signal handler for sigint and sigkill

2005-04-28 23:05  bagder

	* tests/getpart.pm: fixed the attribute parser to better handle
	  multiple ones, with or without quotes around the contents

2005-04-28 23:04  bagder

	* tests/runtests.pl: moved two functions to ftp.pm, made some more
	  changes on stopping servers and fixed the textmode attribute
	  thing for windows a bit

2005-04-28 23:04  bagder

	* tests/ftp.pm: moved in functions from runtests.pl to enable the
	  ftpserver to use the killslaves function

2005-04-28 16:31  bagder

	* tests/server/sockfilt.c: AF_INET6 for ipv6 addresses!

2005-04-28 16:25  bagder

	* tests/: ftp.pm, runtests.pl: no, the kill servers messages need
	  to be verbose, they're too frequent

2005-04-28 16:03  bagder

	* tests/: ftp.pm, runtests.pl: display killed pids to make it
	  easier to see for autobuilds etc

2005-04-28 15:55  bagder

	* tests/ftpsserver.pl: historic thing we will not use

2005-04-28 15:55  bagder

	* tests/Makefile.am: removed ftpsserver.pl

2005-04-28 15:54  bagder

	* tests/runtests.pl: When staring a HTTP server, use the pidfile
	  preferably since it turns out sometimes the server can start but
	  curl cannot speak to it, and then we must remember the server (in
	  order to kill it properly) anyway.

	  Also, make sure to kill all servers on exit everywhere.

2005-04-28 13:22  bagder

	* tests/.cvsignore: ignore more generated files

2005-04-28 10:23  bagder

	* tests/runtests.pl: remove unused ftps-server code and fixed two
	  warnings

2005-04-28 10:20  bagder

	* tests/getpart.pm: if diff -u makes zero output, try diff -c
	  instead

2005-04-28 09:36  bagder

	* tests/ftpserver.pl: kill slave processes when they fail

2005-04-28 08:50  bagder

	* tests/runtests.pl: 1. no longer ask the server for the HTTPS pid,
	  as it returns the HTTP pid (problem identified by Dan F) 2.
	  initial text mode fix for file checks, to allow better text file
	  testing on windows (with regard to line endings) 3. fixed to use
	  the proper ftpserver pidfile to find pid

2005-04-27 23:24  bagder

	* CHANGES, src/homedir.c, src/main.c: Paul Moore made curl check
	  for the .curlrc file (_curlrc on windows) on two more places.
	  First, CURL_HOME is a new environment variable that is used
	  instead of HOME if it is set, to point out where the default
	  config file lives. If there's no config file in the dir pointed
	  out by one of the environment variables, the Windows version will
	  instead check the same directory the executable curl is located
	  in.

2005-04-27 14:28  bagder

	* tests/server/sockfilt.c: listen(..., 1) as 0 doesn't work on
	  Tru64!

2005-04-27 14:27  bagder

	* tests/server/sws.c: display listening port in log

2005-04-27 12:12  bagder

	* tests/keywords.pl: show what error codes we test for too, and
	  show 10 test case numbers

2005-04-27 11:59  bagder

	* tests/data/: test100, test101, test102, test103, test104,
	  test105, test106, test107, test108, test109, test110, test111,
	  test112, test113, test114, test115, test116, test117, test118,
	  test119, test12, test120, test121, test122, test123, test124,
	  test125, test126, test127, test128, test130, test131, test132,
	  test133, test134, test135, test136, test256, test3, test38,
	  test81, test82, test83, test84, test85, test86, test87, test88,
	  test89, test90, test91, test92, test93, test94, test95, test97,
	  test98, test99: keyword update

2005-04-27 11:59  bagder

	* tests/runtests.pl: detect SSL library properly and display it on
	  startup

2005-04-26 23:47  bagder

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES: fixing

2005-04-26 15:08  bagder

	* lib/: connect.c, cookie.c, formdata.c, ftp.c, hostthre.c,
	  inet_pton.c, md5.c, mprintf.c, parsedate.c, select.c, strerror.c,
	  transfer.c, url.c: Cory Nelson's work on nuking compiler warnings
	  when building on x64 with VS2005.

2005-04-26 15:08  bagder

	* lib/setup.h: Since Windows doesn't have/use the POSIX prototype
	  for send() and recv(), we typecast the third argument in the
	  macros to avoid compiler warnings.

2005-04-26 12:55  bagder

	* lib/setup.h: adding a bunch of comments for each #endif

2005-04-25 23:39  bagder

	* CHANGES, lib/http.c, lib/netrc.c, lib/url.c, lib/urldata.h,
	  tests/data/Makefile.am, tests/data/test257: Fred New reported a
	  bug where we used Basic auth and user name and password in
	  .netrc, and when following a Location: the subsequent requests
	  didn't properly use the auth as found in the netrc file. Added
	  test case 257 to verify my fix.

2005-04-25 10:55  bagder

	* docs/libcurl/curl_multi_fdset.3: be specific about what max_fd
	  contains after a call

2005-04-25 00:25  bagder

	* CHANGES, lib/config-win32.h, lib/setup.h, src/config-win32.h,
	  src/setup.h: Based on feedback from Cory Nelson, I added some
	  preprocessor magic in */setup.h and */config-win32.h to build
	  fine with VS2005 on x64.

2005-04-24 00:08  bagder

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES: 2 days, 4 fixes

2005-04-23 23:26  bagder

	* src/main.c: Alex Suykov's ftp upload show progress meter patch,
	  slightly adjusted.

2005-04-23 13:59  gknauf

	* ares/Makefile.netware: fix for recent changes.

2005-04-23 00:29  bagder

	* tests/keywords.pl: show up to 5 (random) test cases using the
	  keyword

2005-04-22 23:59  bagder

	* tests/data/: test33, test34, test36, test37, test39, test40,
	  test41, test42, test43, test44, test45, test46, test47, test48,
	  test49, test50, test51, test52, test53, test54, test55, test56,
	  test57, test58, test59, test60, test61, test62, test63, test64,
	  test65, test66, test67, test68, test69, test70, test71, test72,
	  test73, test74, test75, test76, test77, test78, test79, test80:
	  keywords added

2005-04-22 23:16  bagder

	* lib/Makefile.vc6: Dave Dribin: set CURL_STATICLIB when it builds
	  static library variants.

2005-04-22 23:13  bagder

	* configure.ac: Andres Garcia's fix for building static curl on
	  windows.

2005-04-22 22:56  bagder

	* lib/gtls.c: Fixed the CN extraction

2005-04-22 22:49  bagder

	* src/curl.rc: update the copyright year

2005-04-22 22:48  bagder

	* lib/: getinfo.c, strequal.h: modified this year

2005-04-22 22:47  bagder

	* tests/runtests.pl: ignore the memdump file when showing files
	  after a failure

2005-04-22 22:47  bagder

	* tests/server/Makefile.am: copyright this year

2005-04-22 17:01  bagder

	* ares/: ares_gethostbyname.c, ares_parse_aaaa_reply.c: Fixed for
	  Mac OS X builds based on excellent feedback from Heinz
	  Stockinger.

2005-04-22 15:03  gknauf

	* ares/Makefile.netware: changes for building with IPV6.

2005-04-22 13:51  bagder

	* tests/runtests.pl: modified the test case success reporting,
	  added "test N out of Y" and "remaining: [time]" outputs to hint
	  users about what to expect

2005-04-22 12:15  bagder

	* tests/data/: Makefile.am, test256, test38: test 256 is like test
	  38 but with proxy + proxy auth

2005-04-22 12:06  bagder

	* tests/data/test38: keywords

2005-04-22 12:01  bagder

	* src/main.c: Set the retry delay variables after the option
	  parsing, as bug report #1187787 points out.

2005-04-21 22:11  bagder

	* ares/Makefile.inc: added missing headers

2005-04-21 01:41  gknauf

	* lib/Makefile.netware, src/Makefile.netware: changes for building
	  with IPV6 and LDAP.

2005-04-20 01:38  bagder

	* lib/sslgen.c: prevent compiler warning

2005-04-20 01:37  bagder

	* lib/url.c: added typecast when converting from long to unsigned
	  short, to prevent compiler warning

2005-04-20 01:36  bagder

	* ares/inet_net_pton.c: indented source to look more like other
	  ares code, added (somewhat ugly) typecasts to build warning-free
	  on 64bit platforms (the result of a (char *) - (char *) cannot be
	  stored in an int universally)

2005-04-20 01:26  bagder

	* ares/ares_init.c: sortlist_alloc() is never used on win32, so
	  ifdef out it to prevent warning

2005-04-20 01:19  bagder

	* lib/: hostares.c, hostasyn.c, hostip.c, hostip4.c, hostip6.c,
	  hostsyn.c, hostthre.c, setup.h: only define _REENTRANT if not
	  already defined, and only in setup.h

2005-04-20 00:23  bagder

	* configure.ac: Check for and config for the ca cert bundle
	  properly when built with GnuTLS.  Previously this was only done
	  for OpenSSL builds.

2005-04-20 00:12  bagder

	* configure.ac: when --with-gnutls is used, we assume a
	  bin/libgnutls-config file in the given prefix. Building something
	  with gnutls without it just is too error- prone.

2005-04-20 00:03  bagder

	* configure.ac: remove the warning for a lacking crypto lib since
	  it migth just be a gnutls build...

2005-04-19 10:10  bagder

	* tests/data/test523: added CURLOPT_PORT test when using proxy

2005-04-18 21:53  bagder

	* RELEASE-NOTES: two bugfixes of today

2005-04-18 21:41  bagder

	* CHANGES, lib/url.c, tests/data/Makefile.am, tests/data/test521,
	  tests/data/test522, tests/libtest/Makefile.am,
	  tests/libtest/lib521.c, tests/libtest/lib523.c: Olivier reported
	  that even though he used CURLOPT_PORT, libcurl clearly still used
	  the default port. He was right. I fixed the problem and added the
	  test cases 521, 522 and 523 to verify the fix.

2005-04-18 19:14  bagder

	* CHANGES, lib/http.c, tests/data/test508, tests/data/test510,
	  tests/data/test513, tests/data/test515: Toshiyuki Maezawa
	  reported that when doing a POST with a read callback, libcurl
	  didn't properly send an Expect: 100-continue header. It does now.

2005-04-18 16:32  bagder

	* docs/libcurl/curl_easy_setopt.3: digest works in the proxyauth
	  too

2005-04-18 13:40  bagder

	* include/curl/multi.h: Initial curl_multi_socket() stuff,
	  #ifdef'ed out for now but committed for documentational purposes.

2005-04-18 10:59  bagder

	* tests/server/sockfilt.c: better fix for the socket -1 case

2005-04-18 10:51  bagder

	* tests/server/.cvsignore: ignore sockfilt

2005-04-18 10:49  bagder

	* tests/server/sockfilt.c: safety measure to avoid using -1 as
	  socket

2005-04-18 10:49  bagder

	* tests/ftpserver.pl: allow some more time

2005-04-18 09:56  bagder

	* tests/data/test103: ARGH my stupidity is endless. Ipv4-only hosts
	  don't send EPRT or LPRT.

2005-04-18 08:57  bagder

	* tests/: Makefile.am, ftp.pm, ftpserver.pl, runtests.pl,
	  data/Makefile.am, data/test103, data/test252, data/test253,
	  data/test254, data/test255, server/Makefile.am, server/getpart.c,
	  server/sockfilt.c, server/testpart.c: Modified the FTP server to
	  use the new 'sockfilt' program to do all the socket level stuff.
	  The FTP server communicates with sockfilt using perl's open2().
	  This enables easier IPv6 support and hopefully FTP-SSL support in
	  the future.  Added four test cases for FTP-ipv6.

2005-04-18 07:46  bagder

	* tests/testcurl.pl: Modified to not mix ordinary print to STDOUT
	  with a system() that prints to stdout, since I've found cases on
	  Solaris where the second output mixes with the first and thus the
	  big check-script doesn't properly find the first string in the
	  output stream.

2005-04-18 01:01  bagder

	* docs/libcurl/curl_multi_fdset.3: somewhat clarified that this
	  only sets the fd_sets and expects them to be cleared before this
	  function is called

2005-04-17 01:15  bagder

	* tests/data/: test11, test12, test13, test14, test15, test16,
	  test17, test18, test19, test20, test21, test22, test23, test24,
	  test25, test26, test27, test28, test29, test30, test31, test32,
	  test8: keywords added

2005-04-17 01:15  bagder

	* tests/keywords.pl: minor edits, report the test cases without
	  keywords

2005-04-16 14:43  bagder

	* tests/keywords.pl: starting to produce a summary in HTML

2005-04-16 14:30  bagder

	* ares/ares_init.c: avoid warning on windows

2005-04-16 14:24  bagder

	* docs/curl.1: clarify that > in the verbose output can contain
	  newlines

2005-04-16 02:00  bagder

	* tests/data/: test10, test6, test7, test8, test9: keywords added

2005-04-16 01:48  bagder

	* tests/keywords.pl: initial tool to report info/keywords of the
	  test cases

2005-04-16 01:48  bagder

	* tests/: FILEFORMAT, data/test1, data/test2, data/test3,
	  data/test4, data/test5: started adding "keywords" for each test,
	  to better allow us to sum up what kind of tests we have and how
	  many tests that test certain features

2005-04-15 23:51  bagder

	* ares/inet_net_pton.c: add needed include

2005-04-15 17:25  dmeglio

	* ares/: ares_ipv6.h, ares_private.h, inet_net_pton.h: Attempted to
	  fix c-ares not building on non-IPv6 systems

2005-04-15 10:45  bagder

	* configure.ac: if libgnutls-config isn't found in the given path,
	  deal with it nicer (but it is still likely to not do very good
	  since it can't figure out all the lib dependencies)

2005-04-15 00:52  bagder

	* tests/data/: Makefile.am, test250, test251: Two new slowdown
	  tests for better testing of the FTP response reader function when
	  the response come in many small chunks.

2005-04-15 00:52  bagder

	* tests/: FILEFORMAT, ftpserver.pl, runtests.pl: make the ftp
	  server support reply/servercmd, and make SLOWDOWN work, and
	  update the docs accordingly

2005-04-13 23:17  bagder

	* lib/gtls.c: oops, only negative numbers are errors

2005-04-13 21:31  danf

	* docs/FAQ: Mention GnuTLS and fix a few spelling errors.

2005-04-13 14:38  bagder

	* lib/gtls.c: don't bail out just because the ca file has a
	  problem, it might be OK

2005-04-13 14:37  bagder

	* tests/data/test305: fix port number

2005-04-13 10:50  bagder

	* docs/HISTORY: GnuTLS support

2005-04-13 10:47  bagder

	* lib/ssluse.c: fix compiler warning

2005-04-13 02:32  danf

	* ares/buildconf: Allow environment variables to override default
	  autotools.

2005-04-12 16:17  bagder

	* RELEASE-NOTES, TODO-RELEASE, include/curl/curlver.h: next release
	  will be version 7.14.0 thanks to the added GnuTLS support

2005-04-12 09:56  bagder

	* lib/strequal.h: Provides an unconditional strlcat() proto even if
	  strlcat() was found by configure. An attempt to fix warnings when
	  we build and the strlcat() function is provided by one if the
	  libs (gss or krb4) since then we have no protos for it in a
	  system header.

2005-04-12 09:19  bagder

	* tests/data/test509: requires OpenSSL, as our GnuTLS doesn't
	  provide support for CURLOPT_SSL_CTX_FUNCTION (yet).

2005-04-12 09:18  bagder

	* tests/runtests.pl: support tests that requires 'OpenSSL'
	  specificly

2005-04-11 16:07  bagder

	  address?

2005-04-11 00:56  bagder

	  header

2005-04-10 01:46  dmeglio

	* ares/: bitncmp.c, inet_net_pton.c: Removed usage of u_int and
	  u_char

2005-04-10 00:33  bagder

	* lib/gtls.c: Blah, revert my removal of the extra check since the
	  problem is there for real.

	  Archived thread of the help-gnutls mailing list regarding this
	  problem:

	  http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/help-gnutls/2005-04/msg00000.html

	  (and I _am_ sorry for my confused behaviour on this problem.)

2005-04-09 23:38  bagder

	* lib/gtls.c: OK, I must've been halucinating or something because
	  I no longer see the bug I thought I saw before when I changed
	  this...!

2005-04-09 21:59  dmeglio

	* ares/: CHANGES, ares_gethostbyaddr.c, ares_gethostbyname.c,
	  ares_init.c, ares_private.h: Made sortlist support IPv6 (this can
	  probably use some testing)

2005-04-09 18:49  dmeglio

	* ares/: CHANGES, ares_gethostbyname.c, ares_init.c,
	  ares_private.h, bitncmp.c: Made sortlist support CIDR matching
	  for IPv4

2005-04-08 21:46  dmeglio

	* ares/: CHANGES, Makefile.inc, ares_gethostbyaddr.c,
	  ares_gethostbyname.c, bitncmp.c, bitncmp.h, configure.ac: Added
	  preliminary IPv6 support to ares_gethostbyname

2005-04-08 18:59  bagder

	* lib/transfer.c, lib/urldata.h, tests/data/Makefile.am,
	  tests/data/test249: fixed the 304 response-with-content-length
	  problem reported by Cory Nelson

2005-04-08 18:22  dmeglio

	* ares/ares__get_hostent.c: Added include for inet_net_pton.h to
	  ares__get_hostent.c

2005-04-08 17:41  dmeglio

	* ares/: CHANGES, ares__get_hostent.c, ares_gethostbyaddr.c,
	  ares_gethostbyname.c, ares_private.h: Made ares_gethostbyaddr
	  support IPv6 by specifying AF_INET6 as the family

2005-04-08 11:25  bagder

	* lib/sslgen.c: re-arrange some code to prevent warnings on
	  unreachable code

2005-04-08 10:48  bagder

	* ares/configure.ac: include sys/types.h too when checking for
	  headers as otherwise this breaks on Solaris and FreeBSD. At
	  least.

2005-04-08 07:07  curlvms

	* packages/vms/curlmsg.msg: updated instructions

2005-04-08 07:06  curlvms

	* packages/vms/build_vms.com: fixed control_y trap problem

2005-04-08 07:01  curlvms

	* lib/if2ip.c: cast the call to Curl_inet_ntop for DECC compiler
	  squawk

2005-04-08 00:47  bagder

	* lib/gtls.c: Unfortunately, if a ca file name is set the function
	  fails for whatever reason (missing file, bad file, etc), gnutls
	  will no longer handshake properly but it just loops forever.
	  Therefore, we must return error if we get an error when setting
	  the CA cert file name. This is not the same behaviour as with
	  OpenSSL.

	  Question/report posted to the help-gnutls mailing list, April 8
	  2005.

2005-04-08 00:14  bagder

	* lib/TODO.gnutls: one down

2005-04-08 00:13  bagder

	* configure.ac: set LD_LIBRARY_PATH when GnuTLS has been found

2005-04-07 23:12  bagder

	* lib/makefile.dj: cut 'n paste error

2005-04-07 23:10  bagder

	* lib/: Makefile.Watcom, Makefile.riscos, makefile.dj: GnuTLS
	  updates

2005-04-07 23:05  bagder

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES: GnuTLS!

2005-04-07 22:56  bagder

	* lib/: libcurl.framework.make, makefile.amiga: added new files

2005-04-07 22:36  bagder

	* lib/Makefile.vc6: fixed to build after the GnuTLS fixes

2005-04-07 17:28  bagder

	* docs/LICENSE-MIXING: added some blurb about the GnuTLS license

2005-04-07 17:27  bagder

	* lib/: Makefile.inc, TODO.gnutls, easy.c, ftp.c, getinfo.c,
	  gtls.c, gtls.h, http.c, http_ntlm.c, http_ntlm.h, krb4.h,
	  sendf.c, setup.h, sslgen.c, sslgen.h, ssluse.c, ssluse.h,
	  transfer.c, url.c, url.h, urldata.h, version.c: GnuTLS support
	  added. There's now a "generic" SSL layer that we use all over
	  internally, with code provided by sslgen.c. All
	  SSL-layer-specific code is then written in ssluse.c (for OpenSSL)
	  and gtls.c (for GnuTLS).

	  As far as possible, internals should not need to know what SSL
	  layer that is in use. Building with GnuTLS currently makes two
	  test cases fail.

	  TODO.gnutls contains a few known outstanding issues for the
	  GnuTLS support.

	  GnuTLS support is enabled with configure --with-gnutls

2005-04-07 17:21  bagder

	* docs/libcurl/curl_version_info.3: ssl_version_num is not used
	  anymore

2005-04-07 17:18  bagder

	* include/curl/curl.h: ssl_version_num won't be used anymore since
	  we will soon offer multiple SSL layers and it won't make sense to
	  provide a numerical version for it. I also doubt that many people
	  have used this for anything critical.

2005-04-07 17:12  bagder

	* configure.ac: Add support for --with-gnutls. If configure detects
	  OpenSSL, you need to to explicitly disable that first with
	  --without-ssl. Initial attempt.

2005-04-07 16:26  bagder

	* buildconf: bail out if perl is missing, it is needed for building
	  curl anyway

2005-04-07 10:59  bagder

	* buildconf: check for libtoolize and aclocal to doublecheck the
	  installations better

2005-04-07 09:38  bagder

	* ares/configure.ac: Try harder to see if arpa/nameser_compat.h
	  REALLY is a good header file to include, as it seems at least
	  some AIX versions don't really allow it to be include at the same
	  time as the original nameser.h.

2005-04-07 09:30  bagder

	* docs/curl.1: add SSPI

2005-04-07 00:27  bagder

	* ares/: CHANGES, ares_expand_name.c, ares_gethostbyaddr.c,
	  ares_gethostbyname.c, ares_init.c, ares_mkquery.c,
	  ares_parse_a_reply.c, ares_parse_ptr_reply.c, ares_process.c,
	  ares_query.c, ares_send.c: Tupone Alfredo fixed includes of
	  arpa/nameser_compat.h to build fine on Mac OS X.

2005-04-06 23:14  bagder

	* ares/nameser.h: better errno constant replacements, as mentioned
	  by Gisle Vanem

2005-04-06 20:58  giva

	* ares/ares_parse_aaaa_reply.c: Include inet_net_pton.h for 'struct
	  in6_addr'. Ideally this should come from <ws2tcpip.h>, but
	  Winsock 1.1 should suffice.

2005-04-06 20:55  giva

	* ares/Makefile.inc: Moved  inet_net_pton.h to HHEADERS.

2005-04-06 16:11  bagder

	* ares/: configure.ac, inet_net_pton.h: check for struct sizes and
	  use those sizes if the NS_* defines are lacking (IRIX 6.5.22 it
	  seems)

2005-04-06 16:02  bagder

	* ares/: Makefile.inc, inet_net_pton.c, inet_net_pton.h, setup.h:
	  moved the *_inet_pton protos to inet_net_pton.h instead

2005-04-06 15:54  bagder

	* ares/setup.h: made the ares_inet_net_pton() proto use size_t
	  size, as the function in the code uses that

2005-04-06 02:39  danf

	* docs/curl.1: Removed extraneous comma

2005-04-05 23:14  bagder

	* lib/ftp.c: too late hacking error

2005-04-05 23:07  bagder

	* tests/data/: Makefile.am, test247, test248: test time-conditioned
	  FTP uploads

2005-04-05 22:59  bagder

	* lib/ftp.c: Christophe Legry's fix to grok time-conditoned uploads

2005-04-05 22:20  bagder

	* ares/: inet_net_pton.c, nameser.h: with these changes, it builds
	  on my win32 cross-compiler

2005-04-05 22:19  bagder

	* ares/configure.ac: check for another arpa header

2005-04-05 22:08  bagder

	* ares/configure.ac: check for the arpa/* headers

2005-04-05 20:26  dmeglio

	* ares/: CHANGES, Makefile.inc, configure.ac, setup.h,
	  inet_net_pton.c: Provided implementations of inet_net_pton and
	  inet_pton from BIND for systems that do not include these
	  functions. These will be necessary for CIDR support and IPv6
	  support.

2005-04-05 17:11  bagder

	* include/curl/curlver.h: 7.13.3 in progress

2005-04-05 16:38  bagder

	* docs/FAQ: 5.11 How do I make libcurl not receive the whole HTTP
	  response?

2005-04-05 16:36  bagder

	* docs/FAQ: two more actual FAQs

2005-04-05 09:55  bagder

	* RELEASE-NOTES: restart with a blank page again

2005-04-05 09:37  bagder

	* CHANGES: the smell of release

2005-04-05 09:33  bagder

	* docs/KNOWN_BUGS: bug report #1156287, ftp upload from VMS

2005-04-05 00:38  bagder

2005-04-04 15:21  bagder

	* lib/Makefile.vc6: Marcelo Juchem's improvements

2005-04-04 14:30  giva

	* lib/: hostip.h, hostthre.c, url.c: hostthre.c:
	  destroy_thread_data() made public. Called from url.c:
	  Curl_disconnect().

2005-04-04 10:07  bagder

	* docs/curl.1: spell fixes, based on the Debian bug report #302820
	  submitted by "A Costa"

2005-04-04 01:01  bagder

	* RELEASE-NOTES: fix of tonight

2005-04-04 00:46  bagder

	* CHANGES, lib/http.c, tests/data/Makefile.am, tests/data/test246:
	  Hardeep Singh reported a problem doing HTTP POST with Digest. (It
	  was actually also affecting NTLM and Negotiate.) It turned out
	  that if the server responded with 100 Continue before the initial
	  401 response, libcurl didn't take care of the response properly.
	  Test case 245 and 246 added to verify this.

2005-04-04 00:18  bagder

	* tests/data/: Makefile.am, test245: Test 245 was just added in an
	  attempt to repeat Hardeep Singh's recent bug.  But this works
	  just fine on my host. Plain HTTP POST using Digest.

2005-03-31 22:34  bagder

	* lib/Makefile.vc6: fixed bad comment, pointed out by Marcelo
	  Juchem

2005-03-31 16:42  bagder

	* tests/ftpserver.pl: copyright this year

2005-03-31 16:10  bagder

	* tests/libtest/lib504.c: Attempt to make this code more forgiving
	  for systems that doesn't detect the failed connect "immediately".

2005-03-31 09:02  bagder

	* Makefile.am, Makefile.dist, ares/Makefile.netware,
	  include/curl/curl.h, include/curl/multi.h, lib/Makefile.am,

	  year since changes have been this year.

2005-03-31 08:55  bagder

	* TODO-RELEASE: the cookie API is better and more likely to happen
	  in a separate release

2005-03-30 22:55  bagder

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES, configure.ac: fix configure's
	  SSL-detection for msys/mingw (from Andres Garcia)

2005-03-30 08:31  bagder

	* docs/curl.1: format mistake in --form-string, pointed out by Owen
	  Watson

2005-03-29 23:08  bagder

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES: Better connection keep-alive when POSTing
	  with HTTP Digest or Negotiate.

2005-03-29 14:28  bagder

	* lib/http.c: Don't close the connection if we're in a known
	  negotiation mode and we won't send any data anyway. Probably the
	  bug Tom Moers noticed.

2005-03-29 13:54  bagder

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES: proxy multi auth fix, --proxy-anyauth,
	  ftp-ssl and ftp response reading fix

2005-03-29 13:53  bagder

	* TODO-RELEASE: postpone these

2005-03-29 13:43  bagder

	* lib/ftp.c: When doing FTP-SSL, advance to the next state properly
	  when the response to AUTH has been received successfully.

2005-03-29 13:35  bagder

	* lib/: ftp.c, urldata.h: Fixed the FTP response reader function to
	  properly deal with responses split up in several chunks when
	  read.

2005-03-29 11:09  bagder

	* tests/ftpserver.pl: Made the server send data to the control/data
	  connections using two dedicated functions. This enabled me to add
	  a function that automatically delays between each byte, to proper
	  test curl's ability to read FTP server responses sent in many
	  (small) chunks. See also upcoming libcurl fixes...

2005-03-29 00:19  bagder

	* lib/http.c, tests/data/Makefile.am, tests/data/test239,
	  tests/data/test243: Based on Augustus Saunders' comments and
	  findings, the HTTP output auth function was fixed to use the
	  proper proxy authentication when multiple ones were added as
	  accepted. test 239 and test 243 were added to repeat the problems
	  and verify the fixes.

2005-03-29 00:17  bagder

	* docs/curl.1, src/main.c: Added --proxy-anyauth

2005-03-29 00:15  bagder

	* tests/server/sws.c: modified some log outputs, added comment
	  about auth required as used in test 154

2005-03-22 20:58  bagder

	* tests/Makefile.am: can you spell copy and paste error for me loud
	  and clear? ;-P

2005-03-22 20:46  bagder

	* tests/Makefile.am: provide HTML and PDF versions of the man pages
	  in the dist archive

2005-03-22 19:02  bagder

	* acinclude.m4: When cross-compiling, we do some better checking
	  for the NI_WITHSCOPEID option instead of just assuming it is
	  present.

2005-03-22 11:37  giva

	* ares/ares_private.h: CURL_EXTERN is already in <curl/curl.h>.

2005-03-22 11:36  giva

	* ares/setup.h: Prevent redefinition warning with CURLDEBUG.

2005-03-22 10:23  bagder

	* CHANGES, CHANGES.2004: moved out the changes from 2004 to
	  CHANGES.2004

2005-03-22 02:24  danf

	* lib/select.c: Fixed typo.

2005-03-21 23:38  bagder

	* ares/ares_gethostbyname.c: the same fix here too, typecast to
	  prevent win32 compiler warning

2005-03-21 23:37  bagder

	* ares/ares_gethostbyaddr.c: typecase to fix win32 compiler warning
	  (and intended as other code is)

2005-03-21 23:34  bagder

	* lib/select.c: Modified the VALID_SOCK() macro to become
	  VERIFY_SOCK() instead. It is slighly more involved, but should
	  hopefully not generate any compiler warnings on win32 systems
	  (that can't check the socket based on the numeric).

2005-03-21 09:14  bagder

	* tests/: runtests.pl, data/test150, data/test155, data/test159,
	  data/test162, data/test169, data/test170, data/test176,
	  data/test209, data/test213, data/test67, data/test68,
	  data/test69, data/test70, data/test81, data/test89, data/test90,
	  data/test91: Make NTLM tests depend on the NTLM feature at not
	  SSL, since the NTLM support is no longer only present when built
	  with SSL support.

2005-03-21 08:45  bagder

	* tests/runtests.1: format mistake

2005-03-20 13:46  bagder

	* lib/hostthre.c: removed a (fairly useless) debug output just to
	  compile without warning

2005-03-20 13:29  bagder

	* ares/ares_init.c: silence win32 compiler warnings

2005-03-20 01:38  bagder

	* ares/configure.ac: attempt to fix the ares link breakage with
	  --enable-debug in libcurl and here

2005-03-19 02:03  bagder

	* ares/ares_init.c: silence warnings on win32 about static
	  functions that are never used

2005-03-19 02:00  bagder

	* tests/testcurl.pl: some additional debug output

2005-03-19 01:44  bagder

	* lib/setup.h: fix compiler warning

2005-03-18 19:41  danf

	* tests/testcurl.1: Fixed spelling of --runtestopts

2005-03-18 19:03  danf

	* tests/testcurl.pl: Netware builds don't use configure.

	* lib/Makefile.vc6: fix by Kyrre Kristiansen

2005-03-18 10:21  bagder

	* tests/testcurl.pl: adjust to use plain 'make' even for
	  cross-compiles if using configure- style build

2005-03-18 10:01  bagder

	* RELEASE-NOTES: a Common Lisp binding

2005-03-17 21:50  danf

	* tests/data/test237: Change the bogus address used in test237 to
	  be more reliable when run on a host with a buggy resolver that
	  strips all but the bottom 8 bits of each octet.  The resolved
	  address in this case (192.0.2.127) is guaranteed never to belong
	  to a real host (see RFC3330).

2005-03-17 21:32  danf

	* lib/setup.h: Use the proper macro to do uClibc detection.

2005-03-17 20:12  bagder

	* lib/hostip6.c: include inet_pton.h

2005-03-17 13:16  bagder

	* tests/runtests.1: added descriptions

2005-03-17 13:00  bagder

	* COPYING: update year

2005-03-17 10:44  bagder

	* tests/testcurl.pl: don't set TEST_F to blank when --runtestopts
	  isn't used, as that will override the default options set in the
	  Makefile

2005-03-17 09:17  bagder

	* tests/: FILEFORMAT, runtests.pl, data/test237: support multiple
	  error codes for a test case since some things just vary between
	  platforms

2005-03-17 09:09  bagder

	* docs/KNOWN_BUGS: add 'FTP ASCII transfers' here, since they seem
	  to be frequently attempted these days...!

2005-03-17 09:04  bagder

	* tests/testcurl.1: add new option

2005-03-17 09:04  bagder

	* tests/Makefile.am: add new file

2005-03-17 09:03  bagder

	* tests/runtests.1: its a start

2005-03-17 08:40  bagder

	* lib/: hostip4.c, hostip6.c: use Curl_inet_pton(), not
	  inet_pton().

2005-03-17 01:57  danf

	* tests/: Makefile.am, testcurl.pl: Added the --runtestsopts option
	  to testcurl.pl to override the default options used by
	  runtests.pl during testing (useful for disabling valgrind).

2005-03-17 00:09  danf

	* lib/Makefile.am, src/Makefile.inc: Removed references to
	  config-vms.h from the makefiles.

2005-03-16 23:27  danf

	* lib/config-vms.h, src/config-vms.h: Removed old VMS config files
	  (on behalf of Marty Kuhrt). The VMS build scripts use the version
	  in packages/vms/

2005-03-16 23:03  bagder

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES: more

2005-03-16 23:02  bagder

	* tests/runtests.pl: check for the HTTPS server in a manner similar
	  to how we check for the HTTP server

2005-03-16 23:01  bagder

	* CHANGES, lib/hostip4.c, lib/inet_pton.h: - Tru64 and some IRIX
	  boxes seem to not like test 237 as it is. Their   inet_addr()
	  functions seems to use &255 on all numericals in a ipv4 dotted
	  address which makes a different failure... Now I've modified the
	  ipv4	 resolve code to use inet_pton() instead in an attempt to
	  make these systems   better detect this as a bad IP address
	  rather than creating a toally bogus	address that is then passed
	  on and used.

2005-03-16 03:25  danf

	* lib/: if2ip.c, inet_ntop.c, inet_ntop.h: Fixed some compiler
	  warnings I should have noticed before.

2005-03-15 22:00  danf

	* lib/: ftp.c, if2ip.c, inet_ntoa_r.h, inet_ntop.c, setup.h, url.c:
	  Fixed ftp support with uClibc due to differing inet_ntoa_r()
	  behaviour.

2005-03-15 13:33  bagder

	* tests/data/: Makefile.am, test237, test238: test EPSV and PASV
	  response handling when they get well-formated data back but using
	  illegal values

2005-03-15 13:13  bagder

	* tests/: Makefile.am, testcurl.1, testcurl.pl: initial man page
	  attempt for testcurl.pl

2005-03-15 08:50  bagder

	* CHANGES: new options to testcurl.pl, fixed curl-config and
	  removed compiler warnings

2005-03-15 08:49  bagder

	* configure.ac, curl-config.in: added missing features to
	  curl-config

2005-03-15 08:48  bagder

	* lib/telnet.c: nonsense change for(;;) => while(1) just to prevent
	  gcc from warning on never executed code when -Wunreachable-code
	  is used

2005-03-15 08:47  bagder

	* lib/strerror.c: prevent compiler warning

2005-03-15 08:35  bagder

	* tests/testcurl.pl: Added lots of new command line options, made
	  confsuffix get set based on targetos only and not build os.
	  Commented away the line that enables perl warnings.

2005-03-15 05:47  danf

	* acinclude.m4: Finally fixed the LDAP library searching bug on
	  libtool ver. 1.5

2005-03-15 05:04  danf

	* tests/data/: test20, test507: Make nonexistent host names
	  absolute so tests will pass on machines with a wildcard DNS
	  search domain.

2005-03-14 20:37  danf

	* acinclude.m4: Use the libtool variables better to make LDAP
	  library search work on more platforms.

2005-03-14 16:51  bagder

	* lib/: http_ntlm.c, if2ip.c: hushing up more warnings

2005-03-14 16:43  bagder

	* lib/: connect.c, ftp.c, if2ip.h, strerror.c: silence compiler
	  warnings for mingw win32 builds --enable-debug

2005-03-14 13:26  bagder

	* tests/testcurl.pl: show LDFLAGS too

2005-03-14 10:39  bagder

	* configure.ac: if ws2_32 is used, append the lib last in the LIBS
	  list (too) to make it build and link fine with c-ares

2005-03-14 10:37  giva

	* lib/http_ntlm.c: Avoid "unused variable" warnings.

2005-03-14 09:15  bagder

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES: configure --enable-sspi

2005-03-14 08:46  bagder

	* lib/Makefile.inc: security.h is removed

2005-03-14 01:52  bagder

	* TODO-RELEASE: two issues fixed

2005-03-14 01:01  bagder

	* lib/urldata.h: include security.h with lowercase s to work on
	  cross-compiled mingw

2005-03-14 01:00  bagder

	* lib/: ftp.c, krb4.c, krb4.h, security.c, security.h, sendf.c,
	  url.c: Removed security.h since it shadows an include file mingw
	  needs when building for SSPI support. The contents of the file
	  has been moved into the krb4.h file.

2005-03-14 00:59  bagder

	* configure.ac: Added --enable-sspi that now make libcurl build
	  with SSPI support. This only works when built for win32.

2005-03-13 10:21  giva

	* ares/ares_process.c: Prevent gcc warning.

2005-03-12 23:55  bagder

	* RELEASE-NOTES, docs/BINDINGS: found a common lisp binding

2005-03-12 20:49  bagder

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES: --form-string

2005-03-12 20:39  bagder

	* docs/MANUAL, docs/curl.1, src/main.c, tests/data/test39: David
	  Houlder added --form-string

2005-03-12 18:31  giva

	* lib/urldata.h: Swap <security.h> and <sspi.h> (needed for MingW).

2005-03-12 00:07  danf

	* acinclude.m4: Work around a bug in libtool ver. 1.5 during LDAP
	  library detection.

2005-03-11 16:18  bagder

	* docs/libcurl/curl_version_info.3: added CURL_VERSION_SSPI

2005-03-11 16:10  bagder

	* CHANGES, include/curl/curl.h, lib/version.c, src/main.c:
	  curl_version_info() returns the feature bit CURL_VERSION_SSPI

2005-03-11 16:10  bagder

	* Makefile.dist, src/Makefile.vc6: fixed two leftover from
	  Christopher's patch

2005-03-11 09:34  bagder

	* ares/: Makefile.inc, ares_parse_aaaa_reply.3: the
	  ares_parse_aaaa_reply man page

2005-03-11 09:14  bagder

	* ares/configure.ac: Check for winsock.h to work with win32. Only
	  include system headers we know exist.

2005-03-11 09:06  bagder

	* ares/acinclude.m4: Replace AC_TRY_RUN() with AC_EGREP_CPP() when
	  checking for constants to work fine with cross-compiled builds.

2005-03-11 09:03  bagder

	* ares/Makefile.netware: oops, once is enough! ;-)

2005-03-11 08:53  bagder

	* ares/Makefile.netware: Define HAVE_AF_INET6_H for Netware too, as
	  Guenter Knauf's builds indicate.

2005-03-11 08:52  danf

	* ares/Makefile.netware: Added HAVE_AF_INET6 to Netware's config.h

2005-03-11 06:49  danf

	* lib/: http_ntlm.c, url.c: Fixed some compiler warnings.

2005-03-11 06:39  danf

	* ares/Makefile.netware: Added HAVE_STRUCT_IN6_ADDR to Netware's
	  config.h

2005-03-11 06:28  danf

	* acinclude.m4, configure.ac, docs/KNOWN_BUGS,
	  lib/Makefile.netware, lib/config-amigaos.h, lib/config-mac.h,
	  lib/config-riscos.h, lib/config-win32.h, lib/config.dj,
	  lib/ldap.c, packages/vms/config-vms.h: Fixed LDAP library file
	  name bug (KNOWN_BUGS #1).  configure now auto-detects the correct
	  dynamic library names by default, and provides override switches
	  --with-ldap-lib, --with-lber-lib and --without-lber-lib.  Added
	  CURL_DISABLE_LDAP to platform-specific config files to disable
	  LDAP support on those platforms that probably don't have dynamic
	  OpenLDAP libraries available to avoid compile errors.

2005-03-11 01:44  bagder

	* Makefile.am: Add an alert already here if 'make test' is
	  attempted for a cross-compile since there's no use building the
	  whole test suite first and _then_ tell it doesn't work anyway...

2005-03-11 01:20  bagder

	* tests/testcurl.pl: no more rewriting of the setup file

2005-03-11 00:30  bagder

	* ares/: CHANGES, Makefile.inc, acinclude.m4, ares.h,
	  ares_parse_aaaa_reply.c, configure.ac, setup.h: Dominick Meglio
	  added ares_parse_aaaa_reply.c and did various adjustments. The
	  first little steps towards IPv6 support!

2005-03-11 00:15  bagder

	* CHANGES, lib/Makefile.vc6, lib/http.c, lib/http_ntlm.c,
	  lib/http_ntlm.h, lib/url.c, lib/urldata.h, lib/version.c,
	  src/Makefile.vc6: Christopher R. Palmer made it possible to build
	  libcurl with the USE_WINDOWS_SSPI on Windows, and then libcurl
	  will be built to use the native way to do NTLM. SSPI also allows
	  libcurl to pass on the current user and its password in the
	  request.

2005-03-10 00:35  bagder

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES: configure, socks, debug, getdate

2005-03-09 23:13  bagder

	* lib/url.c: As reported by 'nodak sodak' we should check for a
	  NULL pointer before referencing the proxy name pointer.

2005-03-09 19:40  danf

	* configure.ac: Stopped linking to the SSL libs if a full
	  installation isn't found.  Removed a redundant library check.

2005-03-09 08:56  bagder

	* tests/: data/test517, libtest/lib517.c: skip the test of "2094
	  Nov 6" for now, since the 64bit time_t systems return different
	  values for it...

2005-03-08 23:21  bagder

	* lib/multi.c: remove old printf() debug leftover

2005-03-08 17:31  bagder

	* docs/libcurl/curl_getdate.3, lib/parsedate.c: mktime() returns a
	  time_t. time_t is often 32 bits, even on many architectures that
	  feature 64 bit 'long'.

	  Some systems have 64 bit time_t and deal with years beyond 2038.
	  However, even some of the systems with 64 bit time_t returns -1
	  for dates beyond 03:14:07 UTC, January 19, 2038. (Such as AIX
	  5100-06)

2005-03-08 12:15  bagder

	* docs/libcurl/curl_getdate.3: days are english

2005-03-08 09:09  bagder

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES, lib/ftp.c, tests/data/Makefile.am,
	  tests/data/test520, tests/libtest/Makefile.am,
	  tests/libtest/lib520.c: Dominick Meglio reported that using
	  CURLOPT_FILETIME when transferring a FTP file got a
	  Last-Modified: header written to the data stream, corrupting the
	  actual data. This was because some conditions from the previous
	  FTP code was not properly brought into the new FTP code. I fixed
	  and I added test case 520 to verify. (This bug was introduced in
	  7.13.1)

2005-03-08 04:24  danf

	* configure.ac: Fixed the --with-zlib configure option so that it
	  always adds the specified path to the compiler flags.  Before, a
	  zlib installation in the default path was always used in
	  preference to the one in the desired location.

2005-03-07 19:59  danf

	* src/main.c: fseek() with SEEK_SET is broken on large file capable
	  32-bit systems, so revert to the SEEK_END method of repositioning
	  the stream after a ftruncate() and only use SEEK_SET if
	  ftruncate() isn't available.

2005-03-07 09:29  bagder

	* tests/data/: Makefile.am, test236: test 236: FTP resume upload
	  but denied access to remote file

2005-03-07 09:11  bagder

	* CHANGES: valgrind.pm fixed

2005-03-06 23:33  bagder

	* tests/Makefile.am: added valgrind.pm to the dist

2005-03-05 01:54  danf

	* packages/vms/config-vms.h, src/Makefile.netware,
	  src/config-amigaos.h, src/config-mac.h, src/config-riscos.h,
	  src/config-vms.h, src/config-win32.h, src/main.c: Better cope
	  with a failed or unavailable ftruncate().  Added HAVE_FTRUNCATE
	  to all the static config-*.h files on the assumption that all
	  those systems provide it.

2005-03-05 01:04  bagder

	* ares/vc/: adig/adig.mak, ahost/ahost.mak: Samuel Daz Garca's
	  correction

2005-03-05 00:52  bagder

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES, lib/ftp.c, tests/data/Makefile.am,
	  tests/data/test235: Added test case 235 that makes a resumed
	  upload of a file that isn't present on the remote side. This then
	  converts the operation to an ordinary STOR upload. This was
	  requested/pointed out by Ignacio Vazquez-Abrams.

	  It also proved (and I fixed) a bug in the newly rewritten ftp
	  code (and present in the 7.13.1 release) when trying to resume an
	  upload and the servers returns an error to the SIZE command.
	  libcurl then loops and sends SIZE commands infinitely.

2005-03-04 23:36  danf

	* lib/ssluse.c: Reduced the length of data read from the random
	  entropy file.

2005-03-04 21:10  danf

	* lib/ssluse.c: Don't try to read the whole of the random file
	  because when /dev/urandom is used, it slows initialization too
	  much reading an infinitely long file!

2005-03-04 16:42  bagder

	* include/curl/curlver.h: 7.13.2-CVS

2005-03-04 15:09  bagder

	* RELEASE-NOTES: starting over

2005-03-04 14:41  bagder

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES, TODO-RELEASE: stand clear for release
	  time

2005-03-04 01:26  bagder

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES, docs/libcurl/curl_easy_setopt.3,
	  lib/cookie.c: Dave Dribin made it possible to set
	  CURLOPT_COOKIEFILE to "" to activate the cookie "engine" without
	  having to provide an empty or non-existing file.

2005-03-04 01:24  bagder

	* lib/http_chunks.h: killed trailing whitespace

2005-03-04 01:14  bagder

	* lib/http_chunks.c: killed trailing whitespace

2005-03-04 01:12  bagder

2005-03-04 00:27  bagder

	* RELEASE-NOTES: new VB binding

2005-03-04 00:25  bagder

	* docs/BINDINGS: VB binding, updated the .NET info

2005-03-03 14:13  bagder

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES: mention buffer overflows fixed

2005-03-03 07:51  bagder

	* packages/vms/Makefile.am: fix the distribution files

2005-03-01 00:54  danf

	* lib/base64.c: Fix for a base64 decode heap buffer overflow
	  vulnerability.

2005-02-24 19:54  danf

	* lib/http_negotiate.c, tests/server/getpart.c: Fixed some compiler
	  warnings.  Fixed a low incidence memory leak in the test server.

2005-02-22 19:39  bagder

	* ares/vc/: adig/adig.mak, ahost/ahost.mak: Updated as suggested by
	  Samuel Daz Garca

2005-02-22 13:20  bagder

	* lib/: krb4.c, security.c: krb4 fixed

2005-02-22 13:10  bagder

	* lib/base64.c, lib/base64.h, lib/http_negotiate.c,
	  lib/http_ntlm.c, lib/krb4.c, tests/server/getpart.c:
	  Curl_base64_decode() now returns an allocated buffer

2005-02-22 08:44  bagder

	* lib/http_ntlm.c: Thanks for the notification iDEFENCE. We are the
	  "initial vendor" and we sure got no notification, no mail, no
	  nothing.

	  You didn't even bother to mail us when you went public with this.
	  Cool.

	  NTLM buffer overflow fix, as reported here:

	  http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/391042

2005-02-19 23:33  bagder

	* tests/data/: Makefile.am, test234: added test case 234 which is
	  like 233 but uses --location-trusted instead so thus the second
	  request to the new host will use authentication fine

2005-02-19 00:53  bagder

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES, lib/http.c, tests/data/Makefile.am,
	  tests/data/test233: Ralph Mitchell reported a flaw when you used
	  a proxy with auth, and you requested data from a host and then
	  followed a redirect to another host. libcurl then didn't use the
	  proxy-auth properly in the second request, due to the host-only
	  check for original host name wrongly being extended to the proxy
	  auth as well. Added test case 233 to verify the flaw and that the
	  fix removed the problem.

2005-02-18 12:54  bagder

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES: socket leak, mingw build

2005-02-18 09:24  bagder

	* configure.ac: Based on Mike Dobbs' report, BUILDING_LIBCURL is
	  now defined in here if it runs to build with mingw.

2005-02-17 15:45  bagder

	* lib/connect.c: close the socket properly when returning error due
	  to failing localbind Bug report #1124588 by David

2005-02-17 08:47  bagder

	* docs/curl.1: mention filename= for the -F

2005-02-16 15:31  bagder

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES, lib/http.c, lib/transfer.c: Christopher
	  R. Palmer reported a problem with HTTP-POSTing using "anyauth"
	  that picks NTLM. Thanks to David Byron letting me test NTLM
	  against his servers, I could quickly repeat and fix the problem.
	  It turned out to be:

	  When libcurl POSTs without knowing/using an authentication and it
	  gets back a list of types from which it picks NTLM, it needs to
	  either continue sending its data if it keeps the connection
	  alive, or not send the data but close the connection. Then do the
	  first step in the NTLM auth. libcurl didn't send the data nor
	  close the connection but simply read the response-body and then
	  sent the first negotiation step. Which then failed miserably of
	  course. The fixed version forces a connection if there is more
	  than 2000 bytes left to send.

2005-02-15 00:50  bagder

	* configure.ac: check for ENGINE_load_builtin_engines() as well if
	  engine is around

2005-02-14 23:37  curlvms

	* packages/vms/readme: changed config-vms info

2005-02-14 23:36  curlvms

	* packages/vms/.cvsignore: changed curlmsg.* entries to see if CVS
	  would ignore it now

2005-02-14 10:30  bagder

	* lib/: transfer.c, transfer.h: Rename Curl_pretransfersec() to
	  *_second_connect() since it does not just do pretransfer stuff
	  like Curl_pretransfer().

2005-02-11 23:50  bagder

	* lib/ftp.c: Fixed bad krb4 code. It always tried to use krb4 if
	  built enabled.

2005-02-11 23:42  curlvms

	* packages/vms/build_vms.com: rename amigaos.c and nwlib.c if they
	  exist before building

2005-02-11 23:05  bagder

	* packages/vms/: config-vms.h_with_ssl, config-vms.h_without_ssl,
	  curlmsg.h, curlmsg.sdl: Removed per Marty's request: The .h_*
	  files aren't needed anymore, I consolidated them into one file
	  called config-vms.h.	The curlmsg.h and .sdl files are generated
	  from the curlmsg.msg file and, thus, shouldn't be in the dist.

2005-02-11 22:17  curlvms

	* packages/vms/curlmsg_vms.h: re-sync'd with curlmsg.msg

2005-02-11 22:07  curlvms

	* packages/vms/.cvsignore: ignore curlmsg.h and .sdl as they are
	  generated by curlmsg.msg

2005-02-11 22:01  curlvms

	* packages/vms/curlmsg.msg: sync'd error codes with include/curl.h

2005-02-11 21:17  curlvms

	* packages/vms/defines.com: Added $Id$ and pre-exisiting logical
	  check

2005-02-11 20:34  bagder

	* configure.ac: remove the check for strftime(), we don't need it

2005-02-11 01:03  bagder

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES, lib/Makefile.inc, lib/file.c, lib/ftp.c,
	  lib/http.c, lib/parsedate.c, lib/parsedate.h: Removed all uses of
	  strftime() since it uses the localised version of the week day
	  names and month names and servers don't like that.

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES: valgrind stuff for test suite, vms build
	  and more

2005-02-10 09:50  bagder

	* tests/: runtests.pl, valgrind.pm: Moved out the valgrind report
	  parser to valgrind.pm, to make it easier to test it outside the
	  test suite. Now we also disable valgrind usage if libcurl was
	  built shared, as then valgrind is only testing the wrapper-script
	  running shell which is pointless.

2005-02-10 08:45  bagder

	* lib/ftp.c: typecast assign to ftpport from int to prevent
	  warnings

2005-02-10 02:54  curlvms

	  the two config-vms.h_* files into this one.

2005-02-10 00:16  bagder

	* CHANGES, TODO-RELEASE: David Byron fixed his SSL problems,
	  initially mentioned here:
	  http://curl.haxx.se/mail/lib-2005-01/0240.html. It turned out we
	  didn't use SSL_pending() as we should.

	  This was TODO-RELEASE issue #59.

2005-02-10 00:09  bagder

	* lib/transfer.c: David Byron identified the lack of SSL_pending()
	  use, and this is my take at fixing this issue.

2005-02-10 00:04  bagder

	* lib/: easy.c, ssluse.c, ssluse.h: better error checking and SSL
	  init by David Byron

2005-02-09 16:15  giva

2005-02-08 13:36  giva

	* lib/: hostares.c, hostasyn.c, hostip.h, hostthre.c:
	  Curl_addrinfo?_callback() and addrinfo_callback() now returns
	  CURLE_OK or CURLE_OUT_OF_MEMORY.  Add typecast in hostares.c.

2005-02-08 13:32  giva

	* lib/ftp.c: Don't free too much in freedirs() if realloc() fails.

2005-02-08 08:36  bagder

	* lib/: hostares.c, transfer.c: Curl_wait_for_resolv() no longer
	  disconnects on failure, but leaves that operation to the caller.
	  Disconnecting has the disadvantage that the conn pointer gets
	  completely invalidated and this is not handled on lots of places
	  in the code.

2005-02-07 20:12  danf

	* lib/content_encoding.c: Fix for a bug report that compressed
	  files that are exactly 64 KiB long produce a zlib error.

2005-02-06 13:43  giva

	* lib/http.c: Preserve previous status in Curl_http_done().

2005-02-05 11:25  bagder

	* docs/KNOWN_BUGS: valgrind errors occur too often when 'make test'
	  is used. It is because too many third-party libs and tools have
	  problems. When curl is built without --disable-shared, the
	  testing is done with a front-end script which makes the valgrind
	  testing include (ba)sh as well and that often causes valgrind
	  errors. Either we improve the valgrind error scanner a lot to
	  better identify (lib)curl errors only, or we disable valgrind
	  checking by default

2005-02-05 00:53  bagder

	* docs/examples/getinmemory.c: fix type

2005-02-04 14:42  bagder

	* lib/transfer.c: David Byron pointed out that this -1 on the
	  buffer size is pointless since the buffer is already BUFSIZE +1
	  one big to fit the extra trailing zero. This change is reported
	  to fix David's weird SSL problem...

2005-01-30 23:54  bagder

	* lib/multi.c: if the DO operation returns failure, bail out and
	  close down nicely to prevent memory leakage

2005-01-30 14:26  bagder

	* TODO-RELEASE: Let's add a cookie interface in 7.14

2005-01-30 13:56  bagder

	* tests/runtests.pl: Bugfixed the parser that scans the valgrind
	  report outputs. I noticed that it previously didn't detect and
	  report the "Conditional jump or move depends on uninitialised
	  value(s)" error.

	  When I fixed this, I caught a few curl bugs with it. And then I
	  had to spend time to make the test suite IGNORE these errors when
	  OpenSSL is used since it produce massive amounts of valgrind
	  warnings (but only of the "Conditional..." kind it seems).

	  So, if a test that requires SSL is run, it ignores the
	  "Conditional..." errors, and you'll get a "valgrind PARTIAL"
	  output instead of "valgrind OK".

2005-01-30 13:53  bagder

	* tests/data/: test300, test301, test302, test303, test304,
	  test305, test306: properly mark tests as requiring feature 'SSL'

2005-01-30 13:42  bagder

	* lib/url.c: Use calloc() to save us the memset() call and
	  terminate conn->host.name properly, to avoid reading uninited
	  variables when using file:// (valgrind)

2005-01-30 00:46  bagder

	* src/urlglob.c: Clear the urlglob struct when allocated, since we
	  might otherwise use uninitialized variables. Pointed out to us by
	  the friendly Valgrind.

2005-01-29 23:38  bagder

	* lib/connect.c: include "url.h" for the Curl_safefree() proto

2005-01-29 23:31  bagder

	* CHANGES, lib/multi.c, lib/transfer.c, lib/transfer.h: Using the
	  multi interface, and doing a requsted a re-used connection that
	  gets closed just after the request has been sent failed and did
	  not re-issue a request on a fresh reconnect like the easy
	  interface did. Now it does! (define CURL_MULTIEASY, run test case
	  160)

2005-01-29 23:26  bagder

	* lib/easy.c: Define CURL_MULTIEASY when building this, to use my
	  new curl_easy_perform() that uses the multi interface to run the
	  request. It is a great testbed for the multi interface and I
	  believe we shall do it this way for real in the future when we
	  have a successor to curl_multi_fdset().

2005-01-29 14:54  bagder

	* docs/TheArtOfHttpScripting: corrected the URL

2005-01-29 14:07  bagder

	* CHANGES, lib/connect.c, lib/connect.h, lib/ftp.c, lib/url.c,
	  lib/urldata.h: conn->ip_addr MUST NOT be used on re-used
	  connections

2005-01-29 14:06  bagder

	* tests/runtests.pl: when using valgrind, include a much longer
	  stack trace

2005-01-29 13:01  bagder

	* lib/multi.c, CHANGES: multi interface: when a request is denied
	  due to "Maximum redirects followed" libcurl leaked the last
	  Location: URL.

2005-01-29 00:21  bagder

	* CHANGES, lib/connect.c: Connect failures with the multi interface
	  was often returned as "connect() timed out" even though the
	  reason was different. Fixed this problem by not setting this
	  timeout to zero when using multi.

2005-01-28 23:22  bagder

	* tests/data/test506: adjusted to the moved unlock of the DNS entry

2005-01-28 23:14  bagder

	* CHANGES, docs/KNOWN_BUGS, lib/url.c, lib/urldata.h: KNOWN_BUGS
	  #17 fixed. A DNS cache entry may not remain locked between two
	  curl_easy_perform() invokes. It was previously unlocked at
	  disconnect, which could mean that it remained locked between
	  multiple transfers. The DNS cache may not live as long as the
	  connection cache does, as they are separate.

	  To deal with the lack of DNS (host address) data availability in
	  re-used connections, libcurl now keeps a copy of the IP adress as
	  a string, to be able to show it even on subsequent requests on
	  the same connection.

2005-01-28 09:26  bagder

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES, lib/ftp.c: Stephen More pointed out that
	  CURLOPT_FTPPORT and the -P option didn't work when built
	  ipv6-enabled. I've now made a fix for it. Writing test cases for
	  custom port strings turned too tricky so unfortunately there's
	  none.

2005-01-28 00:03  bagder

	* tests/data/test212: test the EPRT/LPRT/PORT somewhat more

2005-01-27 23:40  bagder

	* tests/libtest/first.c: Use the same work-around for the memdebug
	  stuff as in the command line client, to allow the contents of the
	  env var decide the file name.

2005-01-27 16:59  bagder

	* src/main.c: a slightly involved work-around to prevent the
	  debug-tracing from logging a free-without-alloc as the first call

2005-01-27 16:51  bagder

	* src/main.c, tests/runtests.pl: Make the debug build get the debug
	  dump file path from the environment variable to allow the test
	  suite to better control where it ends up.

2005-01-27 13:59  bagder

	* tests/data/test103: verify a part of the PORT line

2005-01-27 00:18  bagder

	* tests/ftpserver.pl: Make the server ignore the given PORT
	  address, to make it possible to test curl's -P option easier.

2005-01-26 13:05  bagder

	* README: added more official web and download mirrors

2005-01-26 12:53  bagder

	* docs/BINDINGS: new curlpp URL

2005-01-26 12:53  bagder

	* docs/BINDINGS: fixed sort, mention C, the java binding is now
	  maintained by Vic Hanson

2005-01-26 00:40  bagder

	* docs/KNOWN_BUGS: add number to the bugs to make them easier to
	  refer to

2005-01-25 23:21  bagder

	* docs/KNOWN_BUGS: two known bugs

2005-01-25 23:13  bagder

	  lib/url.c, lib/urldata.h, src/main.c, tests/data/Makefile.am,
	  tests/data/test228, tests/data/test229: Ian Ford asked about
	  support for the FTP command ACCT, and I discovered it is present
	  in RFC959... so now (lib)curl supports it as well. --ftp-account
	  and CURLOPT_FTP_ACCOUNT set the account string. (The server may
	  ask for an account string after PASS have been sent away. The
	  client responds with "ACCT [account string]".) Added test case
	  228 and 229 to verify the functionality. Updated the test FTP
	  server to support ACCT somewhat.

2005-01-21 09:56  bagder

	* docs/libcurl/curl_easy_setopt.3: clarify the struct name for

2005-01-20 23:48  bagder

	* tests/: FILEFORMAT, runtests.pl: Added support for "verify" =>
	  "stripfile" to strip contents of the file that is being checked.

	  Also made the server retrying sleep only one second instead of
	  three, to reduce some waiting when fooling around with the
	  servers.

2005-01-20 23:47  bagder

	* tests/ftpserver.pl: Support file names passed to RETR that don't

	  1) the proxy environment variables are still read and used to set
	  HTTP proxy

	  2) you couldn't disable http proxy with CURLOPT_PROXY (since the
	  option was	disabled)

	* include/curl/multi.h: skip sys/socket.h on windows CE

2005-01-18 15:34  bagder

	* configure.ac: check for errno.h

2005-01-18 11:17  bagder

	* CHANGES, Makefile.dist, RELEASE-NOTES, lib/Makefile.vc6,
	  src/Makefile.vc6: Cody Jones' enhanced version of Samuel Daz
	  Garca's MSVC makefile patch.

2005-01-17 21:20  bagder

	* tests/runtests.pl: Add support for server 'ftp2' which is a
	  second FTP server. Useful for 3rd party transfer tests or tests
	  that need two FTP servers.

2005-01-17 20:49  bagder

	* tests/ftpserver.pl: support the new --id command line option,
	  that allows a second (or third or whatever) instance to run
	  without overwriting the previous' logfiles

2005-01-17 15:57  bagder

	* RELEASE-NOTES: mention the name-prefix protocol guess thing

2005-01-17 10:18  bagder

	* docs/curl.1: updated the wording for -B/--use-ascii

2005-01-16 09:51  bagder

	* CHANGES, lib/url.c: Alex aka WindEagle pointed out that when
	  doing "curl -v dictionary.com", curl assumed this used the DICT
	  protocol. While guessing protocols will remain fuzzy, I've now
	  made sure that the host names must start with "[protocol]." for
	  them to be a valid guessable name. I also removed "https" as a
	  prefix that indicates HTTPS, since we hardly ever see any host
	  names using that.

2005-01-16 09:34  bagder

	* docs/curl.1: mention --netrc in the -u description

2005-01-15 10:26  giva

	* lib/select.c: errrno can by freak accident become EINTR on DOS or
	  Windows (unrelated to select). select() can never set errno to
	  EINTR on Windows.

2005-01-15 10:21  bagder

	* tests/runtests.pl: output better error detection, like when ipv6
	  can't resolve

2005-01-14 14:43  bagder

	* lib/: Makefile.am, README.hostip: Added README.hostip

2005-01-14 10:39  bagder

	* tests/data/test511: verify the protocol too

2005-01-13 22:51  bagder

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES, lib/select.c: Inspired by Martijn
	  Koster's patch and example source at
	  http://www.greenhills.co.uk/mak/gentoo/curl-eintr-bug.c, I now
	  made the select() and poll() calls properly loop if they return
	  -1 and errno is EINTR. glibc docs for this is found here:
	  http://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/Interrupted-Primitives.html

	  This last link says BSD doesn't have this "effect". Will there be
	  a problem if we do this unconditionally? S:

	  longer used variables from David Phillips' select() overhaul fix.

2005-01-11 18:08  giva

	* src/Makefile.Watcom: Removed CURLTOOLDEBUG. It caused

2005-01-11 16:25  bagder

	* lib/: Makefile.inc, easy.c, easy.h, easyif.h, multi.c, multi.h,
	  multiif.h, strerror.c, url.c: Renamed easy.h and multi.h to

	  headers with the former names.

2005-01-11 15:59  giva

	* lib/easy.h: ".\lib\easy.h" shadows for <curl/easy.h> in Watcom.

2005-01-11 15:52  giva

	* src/Makefile.Watcom: Fix '!if' expression.

2005-01-11 15:32  giva

2005-01-11 15:00  bagder

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES, lib/multi.c, lib/transfer.c,
	  lib/transfer.h: Cyrill Osterwalder posted a detailed analysis
	  about a bug that occurs when using a custom Host: header and curl
	  fails to send a request on a re-used persistent connection and
	  thus creates a new connection and resends it. It then sent two
	  Host: headers. Cyrill's analysis was posted here:
	  http://curl.haxx.se/mail/archive-2005-01/0022.html

2005-01-11 00:32  bagder

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES, lib/url.c: Bruce Mitchener identified
	  (bug report #1099640) the never-ending SOCKS5 problem with the
	  version byte and the check for bad versions. Bruce has lots of
	  clues on this, and based on his suggestion I've now removed the
	  check of that byte since it seems to be able to contain 1 or 5.

2005-01-10 12:42  bagder

	* lib/multi.c: Use Curl_easy_addmulti() to clear associations from
	  easy handles to multi handles. Include multi.h to get proto.

2005-01-10 12:27  bagder

	* RELEASE-NOTES: edited wording

2005-01-10 11:07  bagder

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES, lib/easy.c, lib/easy.h, lib/multi.c,
	  lib/multi.h, lib/url.c, lib/urldata.h: Pavel Orehov reported
	  memory problems with the multi interface in bug report #1098843.
	  In short, a shared DNS cache was setup for a multi handle and
	  when the shared cache was deleted before the individual easy
	  handles, the latter cleanups caused read/writes to already freed
	  memory.

2005-01-10 10:48  bagder

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES, lib/ssluse.c: Hzhijun reported a memory
	  leak in the SSL certificate code, that leaked the remote
	  certificate name when it didn't match the used host name.

2005-01-08 17:35  giva

2004-12-26 00:15  bagder

	* TODO-RELEASE: issue 54 - this takes sweat

2004-12-25 23:51  bagder

	* docs/KNOWN_BUGS: Test case 241 fails on all systems that support
	  IPv6 but that don't have the host name 'ip6-localhost' in
	  /etc/hosts (or similar) since the test case uses that host name
	  to test the IPv6 name to address resolver.

	* configure.ac, src/getpass.c, src/getpass.h, src/setup.h: My
	  reimplementation and cleanup of the getpass source code. We

	* docs/curl-config.1: mention the new --protocols

2004-12-24 09:59  bagder

	  Fandrich:

	  Here's a stab at a consolidation of the SSL detection heuristics
	  into configure. Source files aren't changed by this patch, except
	  for setup.h and the various config*.h files.	Within the
	  configure script, OPENSSL_ENABLED is used to determine if SSL is
	  being used or not, and outside configure, USE_SSLEAY means the
	  same thing; this could be even further unified some day.

	  Now, when SSL is not detected, configure skips the various checks
	  that are dependent on SSL, speeding up the configure process and
	  avoiding complications with cross compiles.  I also updated all
	  the architecture- specific config files I could see, but I
	  couldn't test them.

2004-12-11 19:46  bagder

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES, configure.ac, lib/cookie.c, lib/easy.c,
	  lib/http.c, lib/share.c, lib/transfer.c, lib/url.c: Dan Fandrich
	  added the --disable-cookies option to configure to build libcurl
	  without cookie support. This is mainly useful if you want to
	  build a minimalistic libcurl with no cookies support at all. Like
	  for embedded systems or similar.

2004-12-06 00:33  bagder

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES, lib/ftp.c: Richard Atterer fixed
	  libcurl's way of dealing with the EPSV response. Previously,
	  libcurl would re-resolve the host name with the new port number
	  and attempt to connect to that, while it should use the IP from
	  the control channel. This bug made it hard to EPSV from an FTP
	  server with multiple IP addresses!

	  fixing curl problems.

	  in Mandrake's bug tracker bug 12285
	  (http://qa.mandrakesoft.com/show_bug.cgi?id=12285), when
	  connecting to an IPv6 host with FTP, --disable-epsv (or
	  --disable-eprt) effectively disables the ability to transfer a
	  file. Now, when connected to an FTP server with IPv6, these FTP
	  commands can't be disabled even if asked to with the available
	  libcurl options.

2004-11-29 19:26  bagder

	* tests/server/getpart.c: zero terminate the buffer spitout()

	  tests/FILEFORMAT, tests/runtests.pl, tests/data/Makefile.am,
	  tests/data/test210, tests/data/test211, tests/data/test212: FTP
	  improvements:

	  If EPSV, EPRT or LPRT is tried and doesn't work, it will not be
	  retried on the same server again even if a following request is
	  made using a persistent connection.

	  If a second request is made to a server, requesting a file from
	  the same directory as the previous request operated on, libcurl
	  will no longer make that long series of CWD commands just to end
	  up on the same spot. Note that this is only for *exactly* the
	  same dir. There is still room for improvements to optimize the
	  CWD-sending when the dirs are only slightly different.

	  Added test 210, 211 and 212 to verify these changes. Had to
	  improve the test script too and added a new primitive to the test
	  file format.

	  be executed" warning by gcc 3.4

2004-10-10 16:08  giva

	* lib/strtoofft.h:
	  MSVC uses 'i64' suffix for 64-bit sizes.

2004-10-10 09:51  bagder

	* tests/testcurl.pl: attempt to make the configure output appear in
	  the build log when it runs on my solaris 2.7 box too (currently
	  unknown perl version)

2004-10-10 09:45  bagder

	* src/config.h.in: set the SIZEOF_LONG define to get the new
	  lib/strtoofft.h fine

2004-10-10 05:39  bagder

	* lib/strtoofft.h: If long is 8 bytes we can use strtol() to get 64
	  bit numbers and won't need our strtoll() replacement function.

2004-10-10 05:32  bagder

	* lib/hostip.c: Prevent a longjmp warning by moving the rc assign
	  within Curl_resolv().  Andy Cedilnik reported. Warning on HP-UX?

2004-10-10 05:28  bagder

	* lib/: strtoofft.c, strtoofft.h: Use LL suffix for long long
	  constants if the compiler supports it, to prevent warnings.

2004-10-10 05:22  bagder

	* configure.ac: If long long is supported, check if [num]LL is
	  supported for numerical constants.

2004-10-08 10:16  bagder

	* lib/progress.c: prevent warning with comparison between signed
	  and unsigned

2004-10-08 00:57  bagder

	* tests/server/: Makefile.am, sws.c: use curlx_strnequal() from the
	  private lib sources instead of strncasecmp() for maximum
	  portability

2004-10-08 00:56  bagder

	* lib/security.c: use curl_strnequal(), not strncasecmp()

2004-10-07 09:41  bagder

	* lib/url.c: use tld_strerror() only if previously detected, since
	  otherwise we can't work with libidn < 0.5.6

2004-10-07 09:41  bagder

	* configure.ac: check for tld_strerror

	* CHANGES:
	  Added tld_check_name().

2004-10-06 20:55  giva

	* lib/url.c:
	  Fixed tld_check_name(). idna_to_unicode_lzlz() should never fail,
	  but return FALSE if 'uc_name == NULL' just in case.

2004-10-06 20:40  giva

	* lib/url.c:
	  USE_LIBIDN: Added Top-level-domain (TLD) check for host->name.
	  Only print a warning if check fails.

2004-10-06 16:58  bagder

	* tests/data/: Makefile.am, test188, test189, test99: test resume

2004-10-06 15:37  bagder

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES, lib/transfer.c, tests/data/Makefile.am,
	  tests/data/test99: Chih-Chung Chang reported that if you use
	  CURLOPT_RESUME_FROM and enabled CURLOPT_FOLLOWLOCATION, libcurl
	  reported error if a redirect happened even if the new URL would
	  provide the resumed file. Test case 188 added to verify the fix
	  (together with existing test 99).

	  a (moot) warning about code that won't be reached

2004-10-05 12:52  bagder

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES: recent fixes

2004-10-05 10:45  bagder

	* configure.ac: make the given path to --with-libidn override any
	  other installation

2004-10-05 10:42  bagder

	* lib/strerror.c: avoid warning for unused variable

2004-10-05 10:40  bagder

	* lib/strerror.c: use idna_strerror() if it is available (only in
	  libidn 0.5.6 or later)

2004-10-05 08:55  bagder

	* lib/formdata.c: Only include libgen.h if we have a basename as
	  well.

	  Mainly meant to deal with the IRIX case which seems to requrie a
	  "-lgen" lib to find the basename function and thus without the
	  gen lib, it finds the header but not the function and our
	  replacement function has a prototype that doesn't match the IRIX
	  one.

	  A different approach would be to make configure detect and use
	  -lgen for the systems that require it.

2004-10-05 08:49  bagder

	* lib/formdata.c: let our basename() be static

2004-10-04 14:54  bagder

	* docs/FAQ: name mix fix

2004-10-04 12:37  bagder

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES, TODO-RELEASE: closing in on release

2004-10-04 12:36  bagder

	* lib/easy.c, lib/hostip.c, lib/url.c, tests/data/test506: Made the
	  dns entry remain locked while a connection to the host remains to
	  allow verbose output during this period. Bertrand Demiddelaer
	  reported and helped fixing.

2004-10-03 23:32  bagder

	* lib/hostasyn.c: set async.done to TRUE last in the addrinfo
	  callback to prevent the risk that the multi-threaded resolver
	  does wrong

2004-10-03 23:02  bagder

	* lib/cookie.c: Replaced the use of isspace() with our own version
	  instead since we have most data as 'char *' and that makes us
	  pass in negative values if there is 8bit data in the string.
	  Changing to unsigned causes too much warnings or too many
	  required typecasts to the normal string functions.

2004-10-03 22:50  bagder

	* configure.ac: when building with libidn support, check for
	  idna_strerror() which is included in very recent versions

2004-10-03 19:38  bagder

	* docs/libcurl/curl_multi_perform.3: added info about how users get
	  info (like the CURLcode return code) from individual transfers

2004-10-03 10:15  bagder

	* tests/libtest/lib503.c: removed trailing whitespace

2004-10-02 15:01  bagder

	* CHANGES, lib/strerror.c, lib/strerror.h, lib/url.c: Gisle Vanem
	  provided code that displays an error message when the (libidn
	  based) IDN conversion fails. This is really due to a missing
	  suitable function in the libidn API that I hope we can remove
	  once libidn gets a function like this.

2004-10-02 14:58  bagder

	* lib/setup.h: removed weird preprocessor juggling not needed

2004-10-01 13:27  bagder

	* lib/formdata.c: someone should hit me

2004-10-01 13:22  bagder

	* CHANGES, lib/ftp.c: Aleksandar Milivojevic reported a problem in
	  the Redhat bugzilla (see
	  https://bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=134133) and
	  not to anyone involved in the curl project! This happens when you
	  try to curl a file from a proftpd site using SSL. It seems
	  proftpd sends a somewhat unorthodox PASS response code (232
	  instead of 230). I relaxed the response code check to deal with
	  this and similar cases.

2004-10-01 13:20  bagder

	* lib/formdata.c: fixed the basename() replacement, reported by
	  Gisle

2004-10-01 08:43  bagder

	* docs/libcurl/curl_easy_getinfo.3: mention when this option was
	  added

2004-10-01 08:43  bagder

	* RELEASE-NOTES: reflect the last few changes

2004-10-01 08:36  bagder

	* CHANGES, TODO-RELEASE, configure.ac, lib/formdata.c,
	  tests/data/test166, tests/data/test304, tests/data/test39,
	  tests/data/test44, tests/data/test71, tests/data/test9: - Based
	  on Fedor Karpelevitch's formpost path basename patch, file parts
	  in   formposts no longer include the path part. If you _really_
	  want them, you   must provide your preferred full file name with
	  CURLFORM_FILENAME.

	    Added detection for libgen.h and basename() to configure. My
	  custom
	    basename() replacement function for systems without it, might
	  be a bit too
	    naive...

	    Updated 6 test cases to make them work with the stripped paths.

2004-09-30 23:01  bagder

	* CHANGES, TODO-RELEASE, docs/libcurl/curl_easy_getinfo.3,
	  include/curl/curl.h, lib/connect.c, lib/getinfo.c, lib/urldata.h:
	  - Larry Campbell added CURLINFO_OS_ERRNO to curl_easy_getinfo()
	  that allows an   app to retrieve the errno variable after a
	  (connect) failure. It will make   sense to provide this for more
	  failures in a more generic way, but let's   start like this.

2004-09-30 22:50  bagder

	* lib/sendf.h: killed trailing whitespace

2004-09-30 21:50  bagder

	* CHANGES, include/curl/multi.h: Gnter Knauf and Casey O'Donnell
	  worked out an extra #if condition for the curl/multi.h header to
	  work better in winsock-using apps.

2004-09-30 21:46  bagder

	* CHANGES, buildconf: Jean-Philippe Barrette-LaPierre made
	  buildconf run better on Mac OS X by properly using glibtoolize
	  instead of plain libtoolize. (This is made if glibtool was found
	  and used instead of plain libtool.)

2004-09-30 16:38  bagder

	* docs/curl.1: --max-redirs is _not_ -Z

2004-09-30 14:20  bagder

	* TODO-RELEASE: added issue 45 "Chris' suspected race condition in
	  the windows threaded resolver"

2004-09-30 09:59  bagder

	* TODO-RELEASE: added five things I want fixed before the next
	  release

2004-09-29 09:21  bagder

	* lib/ftp.c: Fixed an error message: we use CWD, we don't cd into
	  dirs with FTP

2004-09-29 00:26  bagder

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES, lib/easy.c: Bertrand Demiddelaer fixed
	  curl_easy_reset() so that it doesn't mistakingly enable the
	  progress meter.

2004-09-29 00:19  bagder

	* ares/: CHANGES, ares_init.c: - Henrik Stoerner fix: got a report
	  that Tru64 Unix (the unix from Digital   when they made Alpha's)
	  uses /etc/svc.conf for the purpose fixed below for   other OSes.
	  He made c-ares check for and understand it if present.

	  - Now c-ares will use local host name lookup _before_ DNS
	  resolving by default	 if nothing else is told.

2004-09-29 00:04  bagder

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES: recent stuff

2004-09-29 00:04  bagder

	* configure.ac: made pkg-config not get used if a path is given
	  with --with-ssl

2004-09-28 09:11  bagder

	* lib/url.c: Only active the engine code if ssl is enabled. This is
	  how the actual engine member in the struct is used.

2004-09-27 00:35  bagder

	* ares/: CHANGES, ares_init.c: - Henrik Stoerner: found out that
	  C-ARES does not look at the /etc/host.conf   file to determine
	  the sequence in which to search /etc/hosts and DNS.  So on
	  systems where this order is defined by /etc/host.conf instead of
	  a "lookup"   entry in /etc/resolv.conf, C-ARES will always
	  default to looking in DNS   first, and /etc/hosts second.

	    c-ares now looks at

	    1) resolv.conf (for the "lookup" line);
	    2) nsswitch.fon (for the "hosts:" line);
	    3) host.conf (for the "order" line).

	    First match wins.

2004-09-26 20:20  bagder

	* ares/: CHANGES, ares_gethostbyaddr.c, ares_gethostbyname.c,
	  ares_private.h: Dominick Meglio host file path discovery patch
	  for windows

2004-09-26 08:53  bagder

	* lib/ldap.c: Ben Greear's minor fix to build (better) with
	  cross-compiled(?) mingw

2004-09-25 23:28  bagder

	* lib/url.c: allow setting CURLOPT_SSLENGINE to NULL even if no SSL
	  engine is supported

2004-09-22 20:23  bagder

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES: Dan Fandrich patched three tests

2004-09-22 20:21  bagder

	* tests/: data/test503, data/test504, data/test509,
	  libtest/lib509.c: Dan Fandrich's fix to use 127.0.0.1 instead of
	  localhost to not depend on it resolving nicely

2004-09-15 10:07  bagder

	* buildconf.bat, tests/testcurl.pl: no more getdate.c to care about

2004-09-15 10:05  bagder

	* lib/Makefile.vc6: fixed to use the new file. Can we make this use
	  Makefile.inc somehow?

2004-09-15 09:31  bagder

	* RELEASE-NOTES, docs/curl.1: the new date parser affects -z

2004-09-15 09:28  bagder

	* CHANGES, configure.ac, docs/libcurl/curl_getdate.3,
	  lib/Makefile.am, lib/Makefile.inc, lib/getdate.c.cvs,
	  lib/getdate.h, lib/getdate.y, lib/parsedate.c: Replaced the
	  former date parser with a rewrite. No more yacc/bison needed.

2004-09-14 23:31  bagder

	* ares/.cvsignore: ignore more

2004-09-13 22:49  bagder

	* lib/parsedate.c: and moved back the month array to a static one
	  since the ftp code won't need it anymore

2004-09-13 22:48  bagder

	* lib/parsedate.h: removed this file again, we only provide a
	  single public function and that is already in the public header
	  file

2004-09-13 22:47  bagder

	* lib/transfer.c: no longer includes getdate.h, there's no need for
	  it

2004-09-13 22:47  bagder

	* lib/cookie.c: getdate.h is not required to include, it adds
	  nothing new

2004-09-13 22:43  bagder

	* lib/ftp.c: revert the change for the new date parser, as the new
	  one can deal with the old format now

2004-09-13 22:40  bagder

	* lib/parsedate.c: support for YYYYMMDD added, which allows us to
	  keep using the lib/ftp.c code I was previously #ifdef'ing to a
	  different look when this parser is used

2004-09-13 09:57  bagder

	* lib/parsedate.c: added more examples/docs in the top comment

2004-09-13 09:45  bagder

	* lib/parsedate.c: Since many users probably already use local time
	  strings as input, I now made it deal with named time zones as
	  well as mail-style +0200 ones.

	  Seems to work fine. I'm comparing with GNU date command:

	  date -d [date] -u +%s

2004-09-12 20:27  bagder

	* docs/SSLCERTS: describes how you can extract the CA cert from a
	  site using the openssl tool

2004-09-11 22:06  bagder

	* CHANGES: Added parsedate.[ch]

2004-09-11 22:06  bagder

	* RELEASE-NOTES: mention more friends

2004-09-11 21:19  bagder

	* lib/ftp.c: Minor adjustment needed for the new date parser to
	  succeed. ifdef'ed out for now.

2004-09-11 21:16  bagder

	* lib/parsedate.c: more docs and fixed the delta compared to GMT
	  that prevented test case 141 to work with this

2004-09-11 21:12  bagder

	* tests/data/: test31, test506, test61, test77, test78: 1. cookie
	  expire-strings MUST use GMT timezones 2. adjusted date strings to
	  upcoming date parser rewrite

2004-09-11 15:07  bagder

	* lib/parsedate.c: slightly better but still lacks

2004-09-11 11:24  bagder

	* CHANGES, lib/http.c, lib/url.c, lib/urldata.h,
	  tests/data/Makefile.am, tests/data/test184, tests/data/test185: -
	  Bug report #1025986. When following a Location: with a custom
	  Host: header	 replacement, curl only replaced the Host: header
	  on the initial request   and didn't replace it on the following
	  ones. This resulted in requests with	 two Host: headers.

	    Now, curl checks if the location is on the same host as the
	  initial request
	    and then continues to replace the Host: header. And when it
	  moves to another
	    host, it doesn't replace the Host: header but it also doesn't
	  make the
	    second Host: header get used in the request.

	    This change is verified by the two new test cases 184 and 185.

	  fails if the input is already UTF-8 encoded. We check for this
	  case and copy the raw string manually to avoid the problem. This
	  code can be made conditional in the future when OpenSSL has been
	  fixed. Work-around brought by Alexis S. L. Carvalho.

2004-08-10 08:41  bagder

	  username/password, bug report #1004841

2004-08-09 12:06  bagder

	* configure.ac: the krb4 stuff needs -lcom_err to link now, for
	  some odd reason. This is possibly only on some platforms, but it

	  Host: headers on re-used connections.

2004-07-28 20:40  bagder

	  dist archives

2004-07-28 20:40  bagder

	* src/Makefile.inc: renamed CURL_HEADERS, since it is a magic
	  automake name we must not use

2004-07-26 17:45  bagder

	* src/writeout.c: removed trailing whitespace

2004-07-25 08:03  bagder

	* ares/CHANGES: --enable-debug builds static only, Gisle fixed a
	  memory leak and more

2004-07-24 23:47  bagder

	* ares/: ares_process.c, nameser.h, setup.h, windows_port.c: Gisle
	  Vanem:

	  Basically in loops like handle_errors(), 'query->next' was
	  assigned a local variable and then query was referenced after the
	  memory was freed by next_server(). I've changed that so
	  next_server() and end_query() returns the next query. So callers
	  should use this ret-value.

	  The next problem was that 'server->tcp_buffer_pos' had a random
	  value at entry to 1st recv() (luckily causing Winsock to return
	  ENOBUFS).

	  I've also added a ares_writev() for Windows to streamline the
	  code a bit more.

2004-07-24 23:43  bagder

	* CHANGES: autobuilds with ares and curl_easy_reset()

2004-07-24 23:31  bagder

	* include/curl/easy.h, lib/easy.c: curl_easy_reset() added. Need
	  testing and docs. I also think we should make the initial setting
	  up the struct should use this single function to avoid having the
	  initialisation code at two places.

2004-07-24 23:29  bagder

	* configure.ac: AM_PROG_LIBTOOL is deprecated and AC_PROG_LIBTOOL
	  should be used instead

2004-07-24 23:24  bagder

	* tests/testcurl.pl: if --enable-ares is used, we must run
	  'buildconf' in the ares dir before we run configure.

2004-07-24 23:22  bagder

	* ares/configure.ac: --enable-debug now makes the lib built static
	  only since otherwise we get problems

2004-07-24 08:29  bagder

	* ares/maketgz: generate the new configure better

2004-07-23 20:34  bagder

	  email alias

2004-07-23 00:20  bagder

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES: recent activities

2004-07-23 00:18  bagder

	* ares/: CHANGES, Makefile.am, Makefile.in, Makefile.inc, NEWS,
	  adig.c, ahost.c, ares__close_sockets.c, ares__get_hostent.c,
	  ares__read_line.c, ares_cancel.c, ares_destroy.c,
	  ares_expand_name.c, ares_expand_string.c, ares_fds.c,
	  ares_free_hostent.c, ares_free_string.c, ares_gethostbyaddr.c,

	  ares_process.c, ares_query.c, ares_search.c, ares_send.c,
	  ares_strerror.c, ares_timeout.c, ares_version.c, buildconf,
	  config.guess, config.sub, configure.ac, maketgz, setup.h,
	  windows_port.c: - Fixed a few variable return types for some
	  system calls. Made configure	 check for ssize_t to make it
	  possible to use that when receiving the send()   error code. This
	  is necessary to prevent compiler warnings on some systems.

	  - Made configure create config.h, and all source files now
	  include setup.h that	 might include the proper config.h (or a
	  handicrafted alternative).

	  - Switched to 'ares_socket_t' type for sockets in ares, since
	  Windows don't   use 'int' for that.

	  - automake-ified and libool-ified c-ares. Now it builds libcares
	  as a shared	lib on most platforms if wanted. (This bloated the
	  size of the release	archive with another 200K!)

	  - Makefile.am now uses Makefile.inc for the c sources, h headers
	  and man   pages, to make it easier for other makefiles to use the
	  exact same set of   files.

	  - Adjusted 'maketgz' to use the new automake magic when building
	  distribution	 archives.

2004-07-17 10:24  bagder

	  allocated with malloc instead

2004-06-30 14:04  bagder

	* lib/ftp.c: I think 1024 bytes is enough for even most ipv6
	  addresses :-)

2004-06-30 13:53  bagder

	* lib/ssluse.c: Prevent a very long password to buffer overflow the
	  global variable we use when built with a very old OpenSSL
	  version.

2004-06-30 13:51  bagder

	* lib/security.c: removed trailing whitespace, free a missing
	  malloc when returning error

2004-06-30 13:48  bagder

	* lib/if2ip.c: passing in a very long interface name could make a
	  buffer overflow

2004-06-30 13:34  bagder

	* docs/TheArtOfHttpScripting: not PIN code, pass phrase

2004-06-30 13:32  bagder

	* lib/hostip4.c: simplified the check for when to free() the buf

	  the same default connect timeout define as the generic connect
	  uses

2004-06-29 20:45  bagder

	* curl-style.el: Curl_addrinfo is another typedef we use frequently

2004-06-29 20:44  bagder

	* lib/hostip4.c: Gisle fixed a bad free from the resolve reorg, I
	  changed type of the buf variable to sort out some compiler
	  warnings.

2004-06-29 20:43  bagder

	* lib/config.dj, lib/makefile.dj, packages/DOS/common.dj,
	  src/makefile.dj: Gisle's djgpp updates

	* lib/connect.h: corrected the Curl_is_connected() proto

2004-06-29 13:20  bagder

	  fine poll() before it is used to sleep subsecond

	  NULL

2004-06-24 17:20  bagder

	* CHANGES: snprintf and version

2004-06-24 17:15  bagder

2004-06-24 14:01  bagder

	* lib/hostip4.c: ah, simplified my latest change more

2004-06-24 13:58  bagder

	* lib/hostip4.c: fix for systems without gethostbyname_r()

2004-06-24 13:54  bagder

	* lib/: base64.c, escape.c, file.c, formdata.c, ftp.c, hostip.c,
	  http_digest.c, http_negotiate.c, inet_ntop.c, mprintf.c,
	  progress.c, ssluse.c, version.c: Replaced all uses of sprintf()
	  with the safer snprintf(). It is just a precaution to prevent
	  mistakes to lead to buffer overflows.

2004-06-24 12:43  bagder

	* lib/: hostip.c, hostip.h, hostip4.c, hostthre.c: made the
	  Curl_he2ai() take the port number as an int intead, to avoid lots
	  of typecasts all over

2004-06-24 12:43  bagder

	* lib/http.c: use snprintf() to be on the safe side

2004-06-24 11:14  bagder

	* lib/url.c: typecasts to prevent warnings

2004-06-24 11:13  bagder

	* lib/connect.c: only use sockaddr_in6 on ipv6-enabled hosts

2004-06-24 10:59  bagder

	* RELEASE-NOTES: socks proxy support even when libcurl is built
	  ipv6-enabled

2004-06-24 10:31  bagder

	* lib/hostthre.c: typecast to prevent warning

2004-06-24 10:30  bagder

	* lib/hostip4.c: use Curl_addrinfo, not 'struct addrinfo'

2004-06-24 10:09  bagder

	* lib/hostthre.c: fixed problems I missed to fix from my cleanup

2004-06-24 10:08  bagder

	* lib/hostip.c: prevent warning

2004-06-24 09:56  bagder

	* CHANGES: Yet another resolve code re-org

2004-06-24 09:43  bagder

	* lib/: connect.c, connect.h, easy.c, formdata.c, ftp.c, hash.c,
	  hash.h, hostares.c, hostasyn.c, hostip.c, hostip.h, hostip4.c,
	  hostthre.c, if2ip.c, if2ip.h, krb4.c, llist.c, memdebug.c,
	  mprintf.c, setup.h, telnet.c, transfer.c, url.c, urldata.h:
	  Source cleanups. The major one being that we now _always_ use a
	  Curl_addrinfo linked list for name resolved data, even on
	  hosts/systems with only IPv4 stacks as this simplifies a lot of
	  code.

2004-06-23 11:08  bagder

	* lib/connect.c: static functions are better not Curl_ prefixed to
	  make their static status more obvious

2004-06-23 08:17  bagder

	* lib/getdate.y: When adding the return -1 to prevent warnings on
	  some compilers, others started complaining since it won't be
	  reached... So I removed the call to abort() and just return -1
	  instead. abort() was wrong to call anyway since this is a
	  library!

2004-06-23 08:14  bagder

	* lib/connect.c: prevent a warning

2004-06-23 01:56  gknauf

	* lib/getdate.c.cvs: one copy&paste too much, removed the define
	  again.

2004-06-23 01:22  gknauf

	* lib/getdate.c.cvs: argh - copy&paste error.

2004-06-23 01:04  gknauf

	* lib/getdate.c.cvs: syncronized with recent getdate.y updates.

2004-06-22 23:25  bagder

	* lib/connect.c: the hostname variable wasn't assigned and we no
	  longer use it

2004-06-22 23:22  bagder

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES: cookie size

2004-06-22 23:21  bagder

	* tests/data/test46: extended to include a cookie with 4998 bytes
	  of content

2004-06-22 23:15  bagder

	* lib/: cookie.c, cookie.h: David Cohen pointed out that RFC2109
	  says clients should allow cookies to contain least 4096 bytes
	  while libcurl only allowed 2047. I raised the limit to 4999 now
	  and made the used buffer get malloc()ed instead of simply
	  allocated on stack as before.

2004-06-22 23:12  bagder

	* lib/getdate.y: Gnter Knauf fixed getdate.y to remove a few
	  warnings. I removed the ifdef'ed test we never ever use anyway.

2004-06-22 22:02  gknauf

	* tests/testcurl.pl: added new --target option for autobuilding
	  other targets than GNU-like.

2004-06-22 20:26  gknauf

	* Makefile.dist: added 'clean' targets for mingw32 and netware.

2004-06-22 19:22  bagder

	* docs/libcurl/curl_easy_setopt.3: reset CURLOPT_HTTPHEADER with
	  NULL

2004-06-22 17:23  bagder

	* lib/: connect.c, url.c: Moved the "About to connect() to" text to
	  the place where the host name is actually known, as before this
	  text lied when used in i.e FTP.

2004-06-22 10:54  bagder

	* CHANGES, TODO-RELEASE: Gisle Vanem improved the certificate
	  wildcard checks

2004-06-22 10:51  bagder

	* lib/ssluse.c: Gisle fixed the wildcard checks for certificates.

2004-06-22 09:27  bagder

	* lib/getdate.y: Gunter's fix to avoid the notorious
	  YYSTACK_USE_ALLOCA warning we get on several
	  platforms/compilers/yacc versions.

2004-06-22 09:09  bagder

	* tests/runtests.pl: retry to read the sent request a few times if
	  it doesn't exist the first time

2004-06-22 08:50  bagder

	* lib/transfer.c: pass an int pointer when it expects an int
	  pointer...

2004-06-22 08:44  bagder

	* tests/server/sws.c: modified some logging output

2004-06-21 16:58  bagder

	* CHANGES, Makefile.am: testcurl.sh is dead, long live
	  tests/testcurl.pl!

2004-06-21 16:56  bagder

	* testcurl.sh: This is the old script for testing curl, now use
	  tests/testcurl.pl instead.  It is more portable.

2004-06-21 16:20  bagder

	* RELEASE-NOTES: read callback return code and fixed the pycurl url

2004-06-21 16:10  bagder

	* CHANGES: CURL_READFUNC_ABORT stuff

2004-06-21 16:09  bagder

	* docs/libcurl/curl_easy_setopt.3: Added blurb for the
	  READFUNCTION, including the new CURL_READFUNC_ABORT return code.

2004-06-21 16:08  bagder

	* tests/: data/Makefile.am, data/test513, libtest/Makefile.am,
	  libtest/lib513.c: added test case 513

2004-06-21 16:07  bagder

	* lib/: file.c, transfer.c, transfer.h: The read callback can now
	  return CURL_READFUNC_ABORT to stop a transfer.

2004-06-21 16:04  bagder

	* include/curl/curl.h: added CURL_READFUNC_ABORT

2004-06-21 16:00  bagder

	* tests/server/sws.c: when the client disconnects prematurely, dump
	  the request as received thus far

2004-06-21 12:56  bagder

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES, TODO-RELEASE: recent events

2004-06-21 10:37  bagder

	* lib/http_ntlm.c: typecasts to prevent compiler warnings

2004-06-21 10:28  bagder

	* docs/libcurl/: index.html, libcurl-multi.3: updates

2004-06-21 10:28  bagder

	* docs/libcurl/libcurl.3: refer to the new tutorial man page

2004-06-21 10:27  bagder

	* docs/Makefile.am: removed libcurl-the-guide from the dist

2004-06-21 10:17  bagder

	* docs/libcurl/: Makefile.am, libcurl-tutorial.3:
	  libcurl-tutorial.3 is the former libcurl-the-guide converted to
	  man page format

2004-06-19 12:10  bagder

	* tests/data/: Makefile.am, test177: test 177 HTTP POST with
	  --digest that gets a 302 response

2004-06-19 12:10  bagder

	* lib/http.c: When doing auth negotiations or authprobing, we only
	  consider HTTP code <300 to be good.

2004-06-19 11:38  bagder

	* lib/ssluse.c: prevent compiler warning

2004-06-18 15:11  bagder

	* docs/libcurl-the-guide: ispell-buffer

2004-06-18 13:47  bagder

	* TODO-RELEASE: two issues to remember to fix before next release

2004-06-18 08:20  bagder

	* CHANGES, include/curl/curl.h, lib/sendf.c, lib/ssluse.c,
	  lib/url.c, src/main.c: Gisle's "SSL patch" from June 16th 2004,
	  modified by me as discussed on the mailing list.

2004-06-18 08:15  bagder

	* lib/http.c: With David Byron's test server I could repeat his
	  problem and make sure that POSTing over HTTPS:// with NTLM works
	  fine now. There was a general problem with multi-pass
	  authentication with non-GET operations with CONNECT.

2004-06-17 10:07  bagder

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES: large file FTP upload bug

2004-06-17 10:06  bagder

	* tests/: ftpserver.pl, runtests.pl: new daring features, not used
	  by any current test

2004-06-16 11:28  bagder

	* lib/urldata.h: Keep the upload byte counter in an curl_off_t, not
	  an int. 32bits is not enough. This is most likely the bug
	  Jean-Louis Lemaire reported that makes 2GB FTP uploads to report
	  error when completed.  Also padded comments to get them aligned
	  again, only for visibility.

2004-06-16 11:05  bagder

	* lib/transfer.c: Alexander Krasnostavsky fixed a flaw in the 3rd
	  party transfer code that didn't properly check return code.

2004-06-15 13:04  bagder

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES: post with auth problems fixed

2004-06-15 12:28  bagder

	* tests/: ftpserver.pl, server/sws.c: skip the pid from the logging

2004-06-15 11:20  bagder

	* tests/data/: Makefile.am, test176: test 176, use --ntlm and POST
	  when the server doesn't require any auth

2004-06-15 10:50  bagder

	* tests/data/: Makefile.am, test175: added test case 175, use HTTP
	  POST and DIGEST set but the server requires no auth

2004-06-15 10:45  bagder

	* lib/: http.c, http.h, urldata.h: Fix the auth code to enable us
	  to i.e set DIGEST and then find out that the server doesn't
	  require any auth at all and then we just continue nicely. We now
	  have an extra bit in the connection struct named 'authprobe' that
	  is TRUE when doing pure "HTTP authentication probing".

2004-06-14 23:40  bagder

	* lib/setup.h: we actually build and run fine with libidn 0.4.1
	  too, so let's not require anything newer than that

2004-06-14 16:44  bagder

	* docs/libcurl-the-guide: lots of multi interface description but
	  also some general updates and additions

2004-06-14 12:45  bagder

	* ares/ares_init.c: prevent compiler warnings on non-win32
	  platforms

2004-06-14 11:16  bagder

	* tests/data/: Makefile.am, test174: added test 174, HTTP POST
	  --anyauth to server without auth requirements.  An attempt to
	  repeat a reported auth problem. Works for me!

2004-06-14 10:54  bagder

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES: recent action

2004-06-14 10:51  bagder

	* lib/: formdata.c, formdata.h: Allow formposting of files larger
	  than what fits in memory by not reading the file until it is
	  actually being uploaded.  Make sure we build and still work with
	  HTTP disabled - the SSL code might use the boundary string for
	  some random seeding.

2004-06-14 10:25  bagder

	* tests/runtests.pl: refuse running the torture tests without a
	  debug build

2004-06-13 11:08  bagder

	* lib/http.c: moved default: in a switch case to prevent compiler
	  warning that 'request' might be used uninitialized

2004-06-13 10:59  bagder

	* lib/formdata.c: provide curl_formfree() even when http is
	  disabled, it does nothing then

2004-06-13 10:33  bagder

	* lib/ssluse.c: use Curl_strcasestr() when checking wildcard cert
	  names

2004-06-13 10:32  bagder

	* lib/: strequal.c, strequal.h: added Curl_strcasestr() for case
	  insensitive strstr() searching

2004-06-11 19:27  gknauf

	* lib/Makefile.netware, src/Makefile.netware: removed unused
	  include path.

2004-06-11 17:33  gknauf

	  added lib target, load curl.nlm into ring3 by default.

2004-06-11 14:29  bagder

	* src/getpass.c: Tim Sneddon made it build fine on VMS again.

2004-06-11 04:29  gknauf

	* lib/Makefile.netware, packages/NetWare/get_ver.awk,
	  src/Makefile.netware: some more makefile changes.

2004-06-11 03:36  gknauf

	* packages/NetWare/get_ver.awk: respect CVS builds in version
	  string.

2004-06-11 03:04  gknauf

	* lib/Makefile.netware, src/Makefile.netware: some more makefile
	  changes.

2004-06-11 00:24  gknauf

	* src/Makefile.netware: ups! no copy command defined.

2004-06-10 22:25  gknauf

	* src/Makefile.netware: added generation of missing files.

2004-06-10 22:12  gknauf

	* lib/Makefile.netware: added generation of missing files.

2004-06-10 19:11  gknauf

	* lib/Makefile.netware, src/Makefile.netware: make include path
	  overridable.

2004-06-10 15:11  bagder

	* ares/: CHANGES, ares_init.c: Gisle Vanem's init patch for Windows

	  when connecting to a host name that resolves to multiple IP
	  addresses.

2004-06-10 09:46  bagder

	* lib/formdata.c: build again with disabled http

2004-06-10 09:17  bagder

	* lib/file.c: Steven Bazyl and Seshubabu Pasam pointed out a bug on
	  win32 when freeing the path after a transfer.

2004-06-09 10:23  bagder

	* lib/: easy.c, ftp.c, share.c, transfer.c, url.c: Alexander
	  Krasnostavsky's fix to make libcurl build fine with configure
	  --disable-http, which thus builds a libcurl without HTTP support.

2004-06-09 10:22  bagder

	* lib/formdata.c: when built with HTTP disabled, provide a
	  curl_formadd() function anyway to keep the API complete at all
	  times

2004-06-09 10:21  bagder

	* include/curl/curl.h: Added CURL_FORMADD_DISABLED when libcurl is
	  built with HTTP disabled

2004-06-09 10:18  bagder

	* docs/libcurl/curl_formadd.3: removed reference to the removed
	  curl_formparse

2004-06-09 10:05  bagder

	* docs/libcurl/curl_easy_setopt.3: Setting CURLOPT_RANGE to NULL
	  disables it.	Setting CURLOPT_RESUME_FROM to 0 prevents a resumed
	  transfer.

2004-06-09 09:01  bagder

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES: recent changes

2004-06-09 08:54  bagder

2004-06-08 23:25  bagder

	* ares/ares_init.c: James Bursa fixed a RISC OS init issue, removed
	  trailing whitespace

2004-06-08 23:21  bagder

	* packages/vms/config-vms.h_with_ssl,
	  packages/vms/config-vms.h_without_ssl, src/getpass.c: Marty
	  Kuhrt's VMS fixes

2004-06-08 17:05  gknauf

	* lib/config-netware.h, src/config-netware.h: corrected defines.

2004-06-08 17:05  bagder

	* lib/connect.c: delete trailing whitespace

2004-06-08 16:57  gknauf

	* src/config-netware.h: convert to UNIX format.

2004-06-08 16:52  gknauf

	* lib/config-netware.h, packages/NetWare/get_ver.awk: converted to
	  UNIX format.

2004-06-08 16:13  bagder

	* include/curl/curl.h: Kjetil Jacobsen pointed out that the
	  CURLOPT_FILETIME option was wrongly marked as accepting an
	  objectpoint argument while it actually assumes a long.  The
	  comment was also grossly misleading. The man page was and is
	  correct though.

2004-06-08 14:23  bagder

	* TODO-RELEASE: time schedule for this year

2004-06-07 12:28  bagder

	* lib/sendf.c: prevent compiler warning with picky compilers

2004-06-07 10:30  bagder

	* acinclude.m4: Reverted the previous change and redid it
	  differently as it seemed to not work. This is supposed to detect
	  cross-compiling and alert the user, and not do the POSIX-check
	  for strerror_r() if it already detected a glibc-compatible
	  strerror_r().

2004-06-07 09:01  bagder

	* lib/sendf.c: When sending info about which host that sends what,
	  include proper direction to/from, based on a suggestion from
	  Alexander Krasnostavsky

2004-06-04 22:57  bagder

	* CHANGES: configure fix

2004-06-04 21:01  bagder

	* acinclude.m4: 1 - do better when cross-compiling when checking
	  for strerror_r() - alert the user.  2 - don't check for
	  POSIX-style if glibc-style is found first

2004-06-04 14:24  bagder

	* tests/data/: Makefile.am, test173: test 173 added: HTTP
	  RFC1867-formpost a file from stdin with "faked" filename

2004-06-04 09:21  bagder

	* sample.emacs: fixed spell, removed reference to a 'tools' subdir
	  in the curl dir, as we don't have one

2004-06-04 09:04  bagder

	* Makefile.dist: Gnter Knauf's netware fix

2004-06-04 09:02  bagder

	* lib/Makefile.netware, lib/config-netware.h, lib/libcurl.imp,
	  src/Makefile.netware, src/config-netware.h: Gnter Knauf's
	  netware build fixes

2004-06-04 08:48  bagder

	* TODO-RELEASE: 3rd party transfers are in CVS now

2004-06-03 16:42  bagder

	* lib/http.c: updated a comment

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES: updates

2004-06-03 16:38  bagder

	* tests/Makefile.am: the test targets won't invoke the test suite
	  if curl is built cross-compiled.  Pointed out by Chris Gaukroger.

2004-06-03 16:37  bagder

	* configure.ac: set an automake conditional for if this is a
	  cross-compile or not

2004-06-03 15:03  bagder

	* lib/formdata.c: deleted trailing whitespace

2004-06-03 13:43  bagder

	* docs/HISTORY: 7.12.0 introduced IDN support

2004-06-03 13:41  bagder

	* lib/: ftp.c, http.c, sendf.c, sendf.h, transfer.c, transfer.h,
	  url.c, urldata.h: Alexander Krasnostavsky's FTP third party
	  transfer (proxy) support

2004-06-03 13:30  bagder

	* docs/MANUAL: Mention the python-isque mailing list, don't mention
	  the commit mailing lists as they are probably very rarely
	  intresting to the "common people" anyway.

2004-06-03 13:19  bagder

	* docs/libcurl/curl_easy_setopt.3: CURLE_FAILED_INIT is returend
	  when an unknown option is set

2004-06-03 13:15  bagder

	* docs/examples/: Makefile.am, ftp3rdparty.c: Added example of how
	  to use the upcoming support for FTP 3rd party transfers

2004-06-03 12:42  bagder

	* tests/data/test168: corrected to use the proxy user name for
	  proxy auth, as was just bugfixed!

2004-06-03 12:42  bagder

	* lib/http_digest.c: Vincent Bronner made the code use the correct
	  user name + password when doing proxy authentication.

2004-06-03 11:20  bagder

	* docs/examples/: Makefile.am, getinfo.c: getinfo.c is a new tiny
	  example that uses curl_easy_getinfo() to get the content-type
	  after a transfer.

2004-06-02 16:39  bagder

	* lib/easy.c: very minor format edit

2004-06-02 16:06  bagder

	* docs/libcurl/curl_easy_setopt.3: CURLOPT_PUT is deprecated

2004-06-02 15:57  bagder

	* lib/url.c: Made CURLOPT_UPLOAD and CURLOPT_PUT mean the same
	  thing internally (the previous difference was not clear nor
	  documented properly). They can now both be used interchangeably,
	  but we prefer UPLOAD to PUT since it is a more generic term.

2004-06-02 15:51  bagder

	* include/curl/curl.h: *seven* new options to support 3rd party FTP
	  transfers

2004-06-02 13:39  bagder

	* include/curl/curlver.h: 7.12.1-CVS in progress

	  lib/timeval.h: Gisle's adjustments to allow building with
	  lcc-win32

2004-06-02 13:34  bagder

	* lib/ftp.c: Gisle made ftp_mkd static

	* docs/libcurl/curl_unescape.3: Renaud Duhaut corrected the
	  unescaping procedure

2004-06-01 10:09  bagder

	* lib/Makefile.vc6: David Byron made this use the mm lib by
	  default, as was previously done. This might be done differently
	  in the future.

2004-06-01 09:03  bagder

	* docs/curl.1: --create-dirs clarification

2004-05-28 13:16  bagder

	* ares/ares_search.c: free() allocated memory when the ares search
	  can't be made

2004-05-27 09:10  bagder

	* ares/ares_init.c: clear the domains and sortlist when the
	  'channel' is first created so that we can compare if non-NULL
	  elsewhere

2004-05-27 09:09  bagder

	* ares/ares__get_hostent.c: better checks to avoid free(NULL)

2004-05-27 08:42  bagder

	* ares/ares__get_hostent.c: James Bursa's fix to prevent free(NULL)
	  to occur

2004-05-26 16:32  bagder

	* TODO-RELEASE: the CONNECT issue seems fixed too now

2004-05-26 13:49  bagder

	* lib/Makefile.vc6: Mohun Biswas added release-zlib and debug-zlib
	  targets.

	* docs/examples/ftpupload.c: strip trailing whitespace

2004-05-26 10:54  bagder

	* lib/: ftp.c, http.c, url.c, urldata.h: Added a new 'bit' in the
	  connect struct named 'tunnel_proxy' that is set if a connection
	  is tunneled through a proxy. A tunnel is done with CONNECT,
	  either when using HTTPS or FTPS, or if explicitly enabled by the
	  app.

2004-05-25 23:47  bagder

	* CHANGES, lib/file.c, lib/file.h, lib/transfer.c, lib/transfer.h,
	  lib/url.c, lib/urldata.h, tests/data/Makefile.am,
	  tests/data/test204, tests/data/test205: initial support for
	  "uploading" to file:// URLs

2004-05-25 16:44  bagder

2004-05-25 16:39  bagder

	* docs/TODO: removed some stuff that actually is done now, added
	  the --optionseparator idea (not really new, but its better to
	  have it mentioned in here)

2004-05-25 16:28  bagder

	* docs/KNOWN_BUGS: Bug report #948950, excessive amount of file
	  descriptors might crash libcurl

2004-05-25 15:52  bagder

	* lib/Makefile.vc6, src/Makefile.vc6: Massimiliano Ziccardi's
	  updates for the VC6 makefiles

2004-05-25 14:00  bagder

	* lib/url.c: preprocessor magic around the libidn idn_free() stuff
	  to remain workable both with older libidn versions without
	  idn_free() and with libidn versions that gets installed without
	  idn-free.h

2004-05-25 13:59  bagder

	* configure.ac: checl for the idn_free stuff to remain functionall
	  even with older libidn versions

2004-05-25 13:13  bagder

	* lib/http_ntlm.c: remove trailing whitespace

2004-05-25 09:51  bagder

	* src/main.c: make one call instead of two

2004-05-24 17:16  bagder

	* docs/examples/Makefile.am: new example proving that the debug
	  callback works even when the multi interface is used

2004-05-24 17:16  bagder

	* docs/examples/multi-single.c: remove trailing whitespace

2004-05-24 17:12  bagder

	* src/main.c: delete trailing whitespace

2004-05-24 15:27  bagder

	* src/main.c: if no errorbuffer string was provided when a return
	  code was returned, use the curl_easy_strerror() function to
	  provide one

2004-05-24 15:23  bagder

	* docs/curl.1: IDN is a recognized feature

2004-05-24 15:21  bagder

	* docs/curl.1: fixed a reference

2004-05-24 14:12  bagder

	* curl-style.el: meta-m runs delete-trailing-whitespace in
	  curl-mode

2004-05-24 13:57  bagder

2004-05-24 12:46  bagder

	* include/curl/curl.h: delete trailing whitespace

2004-05-24 11:01  bagder

	* tests/data/test171: better name

2004-05-24 10:19  bagder

	* lib/url.c: only idn_free() if built with libidn

2004-05-24 09:53  bagder

	* lib/setup.h: delete trailing whitespace

2004-05-24 09:40  bagder

	* CHANGES, lib/setup.h, lib/url.c, lib/version.c:  Simon Josefsson
	  added a idn_free() function in libidn 0.4.5 as a reaction to
	   Gisle's previous mail. We now use this function, and thus we
	  require libidn
	   0.4.5 or later. No earler version will do.

2004-05-24 09:13  bagder

	* CHANGES, lib/http.c, lib/url.c, lib/urldata.h,
	  tests/data/Makefile.am, tests/data/test172, tests/data/test6:
	  Robert D. Young reported that CURLOPT_COOKIEFILE and
	  CURLOPT_COOKIE could not be used both in one request. Fixed it
	  and added test case 172 to verify.

2004-05-21 22:40  bagder

	* CHANGES, lib/cookie.c, tests/data/Makefile.am,
	  tests/data/test171: While talking to host a.b.c, libcurl did
	  wrongly not accept cookies that were set to the domain .a.b.c
	  (that is with a dot prefix). This is now fixed and test case 171
	  verifies it.

2004-05-21 14:23  bagder

	* lib/progress.c: quickfix to avoid division by zero, possibly we
	  should go over all of these once and for all

2004-05-20 22:48  bagder

	* CHANGES: fixed transfer speed math

2004-05-20 22:35  bagder

	* lib/url.c: killed trailing whitespace

2004-05-19 11:24  bagder

	* tests/libtest/lib509.c: just code formatting and killed
	  whitespace

2004-05-19 11:09  bagder

	* docs/examples/getinmemory.c: language!

2004-05-19 11:08  bagder

	* docs/examples/getinmemory.c: Set CURLOPT_USERAGENT too

2004-05-19 10:16  bagder

	* curl-style.el: The kill trailing whitespace needs to be set
	  better as this way it takes effect globally which isn't nice.
	  Commented it out for now. Display trailing whitespace still, to
	  remind me.

2004-05-18 12:55  bagder

	* buildconf: simplified all die messages

2004-05-18 11:25  bagder

	* buildconf: simplified the automake failed message too

2004-05-18 11:22  bagder

	* testcurl.sh: make this script tell that this is the obsolete
	  version, to make it possible to detect

2004-05-18 11:02  bagder

	* buildconf: simplified the die-line when aclocal fails, the
	  previous one confused the netbsd shell

2004-05-18 09:35  bagder

	* lib/hostasyn.c: + when storing the address in the cache fails,
	  cleanup the resolved address properly + delete trailing
	  whitespace

2004-05-18 09:25  bagder

	* lib/ssluse.c: * seed_enough() was converted to a macro to avoid
	  the IRIX compiler warning about that passed-in argument not being
	  used.  * killed trailing whitespace

2004-05-18 00:07  bagder

	* lib/hostip.c: if shrinking the buffer fails, use the older larger
	  one

2004-05-18 00:01  bagder

	* lib/ssluse.c: Peter Sylvester's patch that addresses two flaws in
	  the peer certificate name verification:

	  - when multiple common names are used (as in the curl tests), the
	  last name needs to be selected.

	  - allow comparing with encoded values, at least with BMP and ISO
	  latin1 encoded T61strings.

2004-05-17 12:54  bagder

	* Makefile.am, tests/Makefile.am: 'make test-torture' in the root
	  now runs a full torture test

2004-05-17 12:53  bagder

	* tests/runtests.pl: removed debug output and trailing whitespace

2004-05-17 12:51  bagder

	* tests/runtests.pl: grrr, fix the check again if no ftp server at
	  all is running

2004-05-17 12:39  bagder

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES: torture testing and a moved CVS repo

2004-05-17 10:07  bagder

	* lib/multi.c: new Curl_done() proto

2004-05-17 10:05  bagder

	* lib/: transfer.c, url.c, url.h: I made Curl_done() take a
	  pointer-pointer in the first argument instead, and if the
	  connection is killed it blanks the pointer it points to, to make
	  it easier to detect usage problems whereever Curl_done() is used.

2004-05-17 10:04  bagder

	* lib/multi.c: better bailing out on memory failure

2004-05-17 10:02  bagder

	* tests/ftpserver.pl: When waiting for the second connect, we now
	  use alarm to timeout the waiting.  This is necessary in case the
	  client never connects or somehow fails to do it timely. The
	  timeout used now is only 2 seconds, which might cause problems on
	  really slow hosts but longer times are painful when doing torture
	  testing on FTP test cases.

	  I'm not sure how this 'alarm' functionality works on Windows or
	  other systems that don't actually have the alarm() function.

2004-05-17 09:59  bagder

	* tests/runtests.pl: improved the check for our own ftp server

2004-05-17 09:45  bagder

	* tests/libtest/: lib510.c, lib512.c: modified to not leak memory
	  if a libcurl function returns failure, for better memory leak
	  detection

2004-05-17 09:12  bagder

	* docs/libcurl/curl_easy_setopt.3: Seshubabu Pasam's format fixes
	  and added notes about DER not working for some (SSL-)options.

	* tests/libtest/lib509.c: make it not leak memory when it returns
	  prematurely

2004-05-17 08:54  bagder

	* curl-style.el: automatically delete trailing white space on save
	  in curl-mode

2004-05-17 08:53  bagder

	* lib/multi.c: bail out nicely if strdup() returns NULL, removed
	  trailing whitespace

2004-05-17 08:50  bagder

	* lib/urldata.h: deleted trailing whitespace

2004-05-17 08:50  bagder

	  clean up properly on failure to enable easier libcurl leak
	  detection

2004-05-14 11:21  bagder

	* README: new cvs instructions

2004-05-14 10:40  bagder

	* tests/libtest/: first.c, test.h: enable memory debugging the same
	  way the curl command line tool already does

2004-05-13 17:19  bagder

	* lib/ssluse.c: memory cleanup and check fix

2004-05-13 17:18  bagder

	* lib/share.c: check that memory allocation functions truly return
	  good data or bail out

2004-05-13 17:17  bagder

	* lib/multi.c: return on memory alloc fail

2004-05-13 17:17  bagder

	* lib/file.c: better bailing out in case of no memory

2004-05-13 17:16  bagder

	* lib/escape.c: curl_free() doesn't free(NULL) but just returns

2004-05-13 17:16  bagder

	* lib/easy.c: deal with input arguments as NULL

2004-05-13 16:14  bagder

	* lib/: http_digest.c, http_digest.h: return CURLDIGEST_NOMEM when
	  a memory function fails to deliver

2004-05-13 16:13  bagder

	* lib/formdata.c: mark a value as alloced when strdup()ed to
	  prevent memory leaks

2004-05-13 16:12  bagder

	* lib/url.c: bail out when no memory occurs

2004-05-13 12:40  bagder

	* lib/connect.c: Gisle Vamem reintroduced the verifyconnect() call
	  on windows as well, and we now use it to provide more info back
	  on connect failures.

2004-05-13 12:38  bagder

	* lib/ldap.c: Gisle: minor fix

2004-05-13 12:38  bagder

	* lib/ldap.h: no more Curl_ldap_done

2004-05-13 11:01  bagder

	* lib/Makefile.am: Added two two missing header files I missed when
	  I removed the noinst_HEADERS

2004-05-13 10:23  bagder

	* docs/examples/Makefile.am: added https.c

2004-05-13 10:22  bagder

	* docs/examples/https.c: basic https fetching script

2004-05-13 09:52  bagder

	* tests/runtests.pl: made 'runtests.pl -t' run over all the tests
	  just like other command lines Also made -t imply -n to disable
	  valgrind, it runs sloooow otherwise.

	  This now manages to run all tests OK up to test case 100 (the
	  first FTP one) for me.

2004-05-13 08:53  bagder

	* ares/ares_init.c: James Bursa's patch to avoid free(NULL) (mainly
	  because the libcurl memdebug system thinks free(NULL) is badness)

2004-05-12 15:24  bagder

	* lib/http_digest.c: Check that memory functions return non-NULL or
	  return error.

2004-05-12 15:23  bagder

	* lib/base64.c: make sure the returned pointer is NULL when
	  encoding fails

2004-05-12 15:05  bagder

	* lib/url.c: clean up and return better on out of memory

2004-05-12 15:04  bagder

	* lib/escape.c: return NULL on out of memory

2004-05-12 14:06  bagder

	* lib/: ftp.c, ftp.h, http.c, http.h, multi.c, telnet.c, telnet.h,
	  transfer.c, url.c, url.h, urldata.h: Curl_done() and the
	  protocol-specific conn->curl_done() functions now all take a
	  CURLcode as a second argument, that is non-zero when Curl_done()
	  is called after an error was returned from Curl_do() (or
	  similar).

2004-05-12 14:05  bagder

	* lib/mprintf.c: return faster when we "hit a wall" while printfing

2004-05-12 14:04  bagder

	* lib/cookie.c: general cleanup to bail out nice and clean when a
	  memory function fails to deliver

2004-05-12 11:02  bagder

	* lib/transfer.c: even if Curl_do() fails, we must call Curl_done()
	  to do proper cleaning up

2004-05-12 11:02  bagder

	* lib/: formdata.c, formdata.h: improved cleaning up in case of
	  memory allocation failures

2004-05-12 10:26  bagder

	* lib/url.c: bail out if we can't allocate the new range string,
	  and make use of aprintf() instead of using snprintf() + strdup().

2004-05-12 10:22  bagder

	* src/: getpass.c, homedir.c, main.c, urlglob.c: Disable memdebug
	  for the allocs done by the app, unless CURLTOOLDEBUG is defined
	  (which it never is atm).

	  Now, we can focus on making 'runtests -t [num]' work on all test
	  cases and we should never leak nor crash.

2004-05-12 10:10  bagder

	* docs/libcurl/curl_global_init_mem.3: new man page

2004-05-12 10:00  bagder

	* lib/: transfer.c, urldata.h: use size_t better for buffer and
	  alloc lengths

2004-05-12 09:56  bagder

	* lib/url.c: removed another jhrg-reference in a comment

2004-05-12 09:55  bagder

	* lib/content_encoding.c: Edited comments only.

2004-05-12 09:54  bagder

	* lib/http_chunks.c: The Curl_unencode_XXX_write() function take a
	  ssize_t as third argument, so we typecast on invoke.

2004-05-12 08:27  bagder

	* lib/formdata.c: Left-over from before the return-code fix. This
	  is probably the code that causes xlc and gcc act differently on
	  AIX.

2004-05-11 23:17  bagder

	* lib/url.c: fixed Curl_open() to not leak anything if one malloc()
	  fails, fix by James Bursa only modified by me.

2004-05-11 23:12  bagder

	* ares/: CHANGES, ares_init.c: - Nico Stappenbelt reported that
	  when processing domain and search lines in   the resolv.conf
	  file, the first entry encountered is processed and used as   the
	  search list. According to the manual pages for both Linux,
	  Solaris and	Tru64, the last entry of either a domain or a
	  search field is used.

2004-05-11 20:57  bagder

	* tests/runtests.pl: revert the accidentally added use of strace

2004-05-11 16:53  bagder

	* lib/transfer.c: minor leak in case of error, thanks to
	  "./runtests.pl -n -t 25"

2004-05-11 16:48  bagder

	* lib/: formdata.c, formdata.h: clear up memory on failure a little
	  better

2004-05-11 16:22  bagder

	* include/curl/curl.h: make the libidn pointer in the version
	  struct a const

2004-05-11 16:21  bagder

	* RELEASE-NOTES: they're at least 36 functions now

2004-05-11 16:15  bagder

	* docs/libcurl/curl_version_info.3: updated to reflect reality!

2004-05-11 14:22  bagder

	* lib/Makefile.vc6: cut out the changelog, it is far from accurate
	  anyway

2004-05-11 13:48  bagder

	* lib/libcurl.def: added curl_global_init_mem

2004-05-11 13:30  bagder

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES, TODO-RELEASE, docs/libcurl/Makefile.am,
	  docs/libcurl/curl_global_init.3, include/curl/curl.h,
	  lib/Makefile.am, lib/base64.c, lib/connect.c,
	  lib/content_encoding.c, lib/cookie.c, lib/easy.c, lib/escape.c,
	  lib/file.c, lib/ftp.c, lib/getdate.y, lib/getenv.c,
	  lib/getinfo.c, lib/hash.c, lib/hostares.c, lib/hostasyn.c,
	  lib/hostip.c, lib/hostip4.c, lib/hostip6.c, lib/hostsyn.c,
	  lib/hostthre.c, lib/http.c, lib/http_chunks.c, lib/http_digest.c,
	  lib/http_negotiate.c, lib/http_ntlm.c, lib/if2ip.c, lib/krb4.c,
	  lib/ldap.c, lib/llist.c, lib/memdebug.c, lib/mprintf.c,
	  lib/multi.c, lib/netrc.c, lib/nwlib.c, lib/security.c,
	  lib/sendf.c, lib/share.c, lib/ssluse.c, lib/telnet.c,
	  lib/transfer.c, lib/url.c, tests/runtests.pl:
	  curl_global_init_mem() allows the memory functions to be
	  replaced.  memory.h is included everywhere for this.

2004-05-11 13:29  bagder

	* lib/memory.h: [no log message]

2004-05-11 13:29  bagder

	* lib/formdata.c: Make this source code use our internal *printf().
	  Also some minor edits.

2004-05-11 10:10  bagder

	* CHANGES: Added recent events to the log

2004-05-11 10:10  bagder

	* RELEASE-NOTES: more changes, more news, more people

2004-05-11 10:09  bagder

	* README: another official download mirror

2004-05-11 09:54  bagder

	* lib/: Makefile.am, msvcproj.foot, msvcproj.head: new attempt at
	  an improved DSP-file generation

2004-05-10 16:45  bagder

	* src/main.c: slightly better dealing of bad mem situations

2004-05-10 16:22  bagder

	* lib/http.c: Moved the fetching of the list of matching cookies to
	  make it easier to free that list in case something goes wrong in
	  the function and we must bail out.  Courtesy of the torture
	  testing.

2004-05-10 16:21  bagder

	* lib/sendf.c: curl_slist_append() fixed to clear up properly if a
	  memory function fails

2004-05-10 16:04  bagder

	* src/main.c: better detect if/when curl_slist_append() returns
	  failure, and bail out accordingly

2004-05-10 16:04  bagder

	* lib/cookie.c: if a malloc fails, clear up the memory and return
	  failure

2004-05-10 12:52  bagder

	* lib/http.c: typo

2004-05-10 12:50  bagder

	* lib/mprintf.c: the aprintf() versions now return NULL if _any_
	  alloc along the way failed, previously they could return a piece
	  of the string, making it impossible for the caller to detect
	  errors.

2004-05-10 12:49  bagder

	* lib/http.c: better detection for when add_buffer() returns
	  failure, and return when that happens

2004-05-10 11:17  bagder

	* lib/hash.c: Curl_hash_add() was modified to clear up better in
	  case of internal failure.  When failing, it should not tamper at
	  all with the data it was supposed to add to the cache.

2004-05-10 11:16  bagder

	* src/main.c: checkpasswd() prevents segfault by checking that
	  input argument is non-NULL

2004-05-10 11:01  bagder

	* tests/runtests.pl: James Bursa's adjustments to make the -t
	  option work for any test case.

	  The -t is the "torture" test that first runs the test and counts
	  the number of allocations performed during it, then it runs the
	  test repeatedly over and over again and makes alloc number N fail
	  to verify that we detect and return properly from error cases
	  everywhere.

2004-05-10 10:57  bagder

	* lib/llist.c: make Curl_llist_insert_next() fail properly if
	  malloc() fails

2004-05-10 10:57  bagder

	* lib/hash.c: better checking that strdup() works

2004-05-10 10:09  bagder

	* lib/http_digest.c: Luca fixed the nc= in the digest line since it
	  apparantly should not have quotes...

2004-05-10 09:11  bagder

	* lib/formdata.c: James Bursa added better error checking for
	  failer memory calls when building formposts

2004-05-10 09:03  bagder

	* lib/: msvcproj.foot, msvcproj.head: build curllib.dsp from these

2004-05-10 08:29  bagder

	* tests/runtests.pl: don't use -i when checking for our own server

2004-05-07 22:08  bagder

	* CHANGES: James' and Gisle' reports/fixes

2004-05-07 20:56  bagder

	* lib/hostares.c: James Bursa changed two error message to use the
	  display-name instead of the internally-used name.

2004-05-07 20:54  bagder

	* tests/memanalyze.pl: James Bursa's fix to make this deal with
	  malloc(0) as OK to free()

2004-05-07 20:46  bagder

	* lib/: url.c, urldata.h: We don't support any long protocol names
	  so we can use a smaller buffer.  Also, make sure we have room for
	  the trailing zero, only scan to size-1.

	  Gisle Vanem reported.

2004-05-07 11:50  bagder

	* lib/formdata.c: count the formdata size using a 64bit size if
	  avaialble

2004-05-07 11:45  bagder

	* CHANGES: Made the lib/curllib.dsp file get generated automaticly

2004-05-07 11:42  bagder

	* lib/Makefile.am: don't use a magic define name

2004-05-07 11:41  bagder

	* lib/curllib.dsp: This file is now generated at dist-time.

2004-05-07 11:41  bagder

	* lib/Makefile.am: Generate curllib.dsp on dist.time from
	  msvcproj.head msvcproj.foot and the known source files. Not
	  actually verified to work yet.

2004-05-07 08:18  bagder

	* lib/hostares.c: get the display host name properly

2004-05-06 17:17  bagder

	* lib/url.c: removed two odd comments

2004-05-06 17:11  bagder

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES: little fixes

2004-05-06 17:05  bagder

	* configure.ac: removed the warning if libidn isn't found

2004-05-06 17:04  bagder

	* configure.ac: very minor output change

2004-05-06 15:29  bagder

	* tests/libtest/lib506.c: simplied the creation of new urls

2004-05-06 15:21  bagder

	* tests/server/sws.c: %ld for long

2004-05-06 14:44  bagder

	* tests/server/sws.c: int/long fix

2004-05-06 13:10  bagder

	* lib/hostares.c: Michael Benedict brought a fix that fills in the
	  errorbuffer properly when ares fails to resolve a name. This was
	  fixed before but somehow has fallen out again!

2004-05-06 13:02  bagder

	* acinclude.m4: typo AGAIN

2004-05-06 12:58  bagder

	* acinclude.m4: When using the icc compiler, we also ignore remark
	  #1418 "external definition with no prior declaration" since this
	  is a habit we have in the code.

2004-05-06 12:57  bagder

	* tests/libtest/lib509.c: printf %s with plain 'char *', not
	  unsigned ones to silence icc's picky warnings

2004-05-06 12:49  bagder

	* acinclude.m4, lib/strerror.c: if no strerror_r prototype is
	  found, we provide our own to prevent picky compilers to warn

2004-05-06 09:32  bagder

	* lib/version.c: removed the unused 'len' variable, made use of the
	  ptr pointer even if no extra lib is used to prevent compiler
	  warnings ("variable set but not used") on that case

2004-05-06 09:24  bagder

	* lib/version.c: typecast the unsigned long to plain long to
	  prevent compiler warnings

2004-05-06 09:22  bagder

	* lib/ldap.c: unused variable removed

2004-05-06 09:21  bagder

	* lib/http_digest.c: use %ld to printf now.tv_sec

2004-05-06 09:19  bagder

	* lib/Makefile.am: curlx.h is a header to add to the release
	  archive(s)

2004-05-05 22:12  bagder

	* tests/runtests.pl: fixed typo

2004-05-05 16:34  bagder

	* tests/runtests.pl: Temporary disable the logic that runs gdb on a
	  core dump, as it can't blindly assume that the curl file is a
	  proper binary, it is often a script file produced by libtool.

2004-05-05 16:22  bagder

	* lib/progress.c: hm, avoid division by zero more carefully with
	  that new percentage math

2004-05-05 16:08  bagder

	* lib/ldap.c: Joe Halpin fixed the warning on the typecast from
	  data pointer to function pointer!

2004-05-05 15:44  bagder

	* lib/progress.c: Gisle fixed the percentage to work, I adjusted it
	  slightly to not as easily overflow on 32bit filesize-systems

2004-05-05 15:42  bagder

	* lib/: if2ip.c, if2ip.h: Gisle-fix: constified the 'interface'
	  argument.

2004-05-05 15:42  bagder

	* lib/libcurl.def: Gisle fix: curl_formparse is gone.

2004-05-05 15:41  bagder

	* lib/memdebug.c: Gisle fixed: don't reference 'mem' if it's NULL.

2004-05-05 15:00  bagder

	* lib/http.c: initiate variables properly to default to no auth for
	  server and proxy

2004-05-05 12:26  bagder

	* configure.ac: AC_CHECK_TOOL is prolly better to use when checking
	  for ar

2004-05-05 11:20  bagder

	* src/writeout.c: slightly odd fix to prevent -Wunreachable-code to
	  warn

2004-05-05 11:17  bagder

	* configure.ac: alert the user if 'sed' or 'ar' couldn't be found,
	  as it might very well render a build impossible

2004-05-05 10:43  bagder

	* lib/progress.c: made the progress meter display not overflow even
	  if _very_ large files are transfered. The maximum size we support
	  now is 8 exabytes, which equals to 8192 petabytes...

2004-05-05 09:45  bagder

	* lib/progress.c: if the values allow it, avoid floting point math
	  for the current speed

2004-05-05 09:30  bagder

	* src/main.c: additional typecasts in an attempt to avoid compiler
	  warnings when switching from 64 bit types to 32 bit ones

2004-05-05 09:20  bagder

	* src/main.c: removed bad free()

2004-05-05 09:17  bagder

	* lib/url.c: do the alarm time-left math using unsigned longs since
	  that is what alarm() returns and uses as input and converting to
	  signed generates warnings and actually risks loss of accuracy

2004-05-05 09:08  bagder

	* lib/url.c: fix_hostname() now (void)s the conn argument to
	  prevent warnings on non-idn enabled builds

2004-05-05 09:01  bagder

	* lib/sendf.c: ERR_error_string() returns an unsigned long so we
	  should use one of those for the return code

2004-05-05 08:59  bagder

	* acinclude.m4: gcc 3.4 now uses the -Wunreachable-code option, I
	  believe we can make older ones use this too...

2004-05-05 08:57  bagder

	* configure.ac: check the size of size_t for lib/mprintf.c

2004-05-05 08:57  bagder

	* lib/: mprintf.c, transfer.c, url.c: prevent warnings when using
	  the gcc option -Wunreachable-code

2004-05-05 08:57  bagder

	* lib/memdebug.c: make the memlimit final NULL return get written
	  to stderr as wella

2004-05-05 08:12  bagder

	* README: mention the LICENSE-MIXING document

2004-05-05 08:11  bagder

	* docs/: TODO, libcurl/libcurl-easy.3, libcurl/libcurl.3: minor
	  update edits

2004-05-05 08:11  bagder

	* tests/runtests.pl: added a third URL to the torture testing, this
	  one also hangs at some point for a reason I don't know

2004-05-04 16:36  bagder

	* docs/TODO: multipart formposts should be more streamy

2004-05-04 16:27  bagder

	* lib/http.c: bail out when an add_buffer() function returns
	  failure

2004-05-04 15:40  bagder

	* lib/: hash.c, hostip.c: improved the cleaning up of memory when
	  we fail to resolve names due to out of memory (thanks to
	  'runtests.pl -t')

2004-05-04 15:39  bagder

	* lib/http.c: check malloc() return code

2004-05-04 11:31  bagder

	* lib/formdata.c: removed more leftovers from the formparse
	  function

2004-05-04 10:24  bagder

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES, docs/TODO, docs/libcurl/Makefile.am,
	  docs/libcurl/curl_formparse.3, docs/libcurl/index.html,
	  include/curl/curl.h, lib/Makefile.am, lib/formdata.c: removed
	  curl_formparse() from the library

2004-05-04 09:54  bagder

	* TODO-RELEASE: Gisle made item 38, now there's only one low-prio
	  task left...

2004-05-04 09:52  bagder

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES, lib/http.c, lib/http.h,
	  lib/http_digest.c, lib/http_digest.h, lib/http_ntlm.c,
	  lib/transfer.c, lib/url.c, lib/urldata.h, tests/data/Makefile.am,
	  tests/data/test16, tests/data/test167, tests/data/test168,
	  tests/data/test169, tests/data/test503, tests/data/test63,
	  tests/data/test80, tests/data/test82, tests/data/test85: General
	  HTTP authentication cleanup and fixes

2004-05-03 17:01  bagder

	* lib/ldap.c: Gisle fixed the problem with ldap_search_s() fails
	  with "filter error": a case of using 'lud_filter' after freeing
	  'lud_dn'.

2004-05-03 16:57  bagder

	* tests/data/test80: improved the name of the test

2004-05-03 16:55  bagder

	* docs/curl.1: Added --proxy-digest, added the standard curl source
	  header to this file.

2004-05-03 16:40  bagder

	* docs/libcurl/Makefile.am: fixed the pdf and html for the strerror
	  functions

2004-05-03 13:56  bagder

	* src/main.c: Added support for --proxy-digest

2004-05-03 11:17  bagder

	* ares/ares_init.c: don't free(NULL)

2004-05-03 11:14  bagder

	* lib/ldap.c: Gisle Vanem:

	  Patch for ldap.c under Windows. It works with wldap32.dll as
	  supplied with Win-98/ME/2000/XP, so no extra .dlls are required.
	  I've mostly tested it against Verisign's ldap server. Added code
	  in the case there are to many responses (rc =
	  LDAP_SIZELIMIT_EXCEEDED) and print only those we got. E.g.

	  curl
	  ldap://directory.verisign.net/?cn,display-name,mail,info?subtree?(cn=*Nelson*)

	  will print the first 10 results.

	  My only problem with it is that ldap_search_s() fails with
	  "filter error" when CURLDEBUG is defined ?! Maybe someone can
	  spot the error.

2004-04-30 12:55  bagder

	* CHANGES: mucho

2004-04-30 12:37  bagder

	* tests/runtests.pl: Display "exit OK" when the exit code has been
	  verified to be OK, and added initial basic valgrind-log scan for
	  memory leaks it could detect.

2004-04-30 12:34  bagder

	* include/curl/curl.h: deprecated functions

2004-04-30 11:17  bagder

	* TODO-RELEASE: 25 and 37 are now done, only two low-prio tasks
	  left for the 7.12 release

2004-04-30 10:52  bagder

	* RELEASE-NOTES: recent changes

2004-04-30 10:51  bagder

	* lib/README.curlx: updated with more and new info

2004-04-30 10:38  bagder

	* docs/libcurl/: curl_getenv.3, curl_mprintf.3, curl_strequal.3:
	  these functions are marked to get removed from the public API
	  "soon"

2004-04-30 10:23  bagder

	* src/main.c: use the new lib/curlx.h header and modified the code
	  to use all to-become- curlx_-functions with the new prefix to
	  prepare this code for the future removal of several
	  curl_-functions from the public libcurl API.

2004-04-30 10:22  bagder

	* lib/curlx.h: New header file that offers easy access to the
	  curlx_ functions for an app.	curlx_ functions are NOT part of
	  the offical API, but only available as source code functions from
	  the lib directory in case of need.

2004-04-30 10:03  bagder

	* tests/: getpart.pm, runtests.pl: support the new libcurl IDN
	  feature, also a first attempt to display a stack trace if a test
	  results in a 'core' file and gdb is present

2004-04-30 10:00  bagder

	* tests/FILEFORMAT: idn is a new feature that can be made required
	  for a test

2004-04-30 08:46  bagder

	* tests/data/: Makefile.am, test166: added test 166, formpost with
	  white space in file name

2004-04-30 08:45  bagder

	* src/main.c: make the contents able to be any data, the previous
	  stopped at white space

2004-04-30 07:53  bagder

	* lib/http_digest.c: oops, a bad strtok() was fixed by Luca

2004-04-30 07:51  bagder

	* tests/server/sws.c: include the full size of the sent response in
	  the log

2004-04-29 16:33  bagder

	* tests/memanalyze.pl: Gisle fixed the counting of calloc()s

2004-04-29 15:43  bagder

	* tests/data/: Makefile.am, test165: Introducing IDN host name
	  testing. Test case 165 requires an IDN-capable libcurl.

2004-04-29 15:41  bagder

	* lib/: http.c, url.c: fixed the host/proxy name issue when
	  re-using a connection and made IDN names work when using proxy by
	  converting the IDN-name to the ACE-encoded version before the
	  request-URL is passed to the proxy.

2004-04-29 15:31  bagder

	* tests/runtests.pl: remove newline from matching pattern

2004-04-29 15:24  bagder

	* tests/data/test153: ignore cnonce lines too as they are based on
	  the current time and will differ from time to time!

2004-04-29 13:57  bagder

	* lib/url.c: encode the correct name

2004-04-29 12:58  bagder

	* lib/easy.c: curl_easy_duphandle() works again with ares enabled

2004-04-29 12:57  bagder

	* tests/data/: Makefile.am, test512: test 512 does some basic
	  curl_easy_duphandle() testing

2004-04-29 12:56  bagder

	* tests/libtest/: Makefile.am, lib512.c: new test case for a simple
	  curl_easy_duphandle() test

2004-04-29 12:47  bagder

	* tests/data/test153: updated to work with the new Digest code

2004-04-29 10:18  bagder

	* lib/: http_digest.c, urldata.h: Luca Altea's major HTTP Digest
	  update

2004-04-29 09:36  bagder

	* lib/ssluse.c: Gisle made the code use ERR_error_string_n()

2004-04-28 22:34  bagder

	* lib/krb4.c: the new way of accessing the host name

2004-04-27 20:31  bagder

	* docs/: LICENSE-MIXING, Makefile.am: Added LICENSE-MIXING to the
	  release archive

2004-04-27 17:19  bagder

	* lib/easy.c: IDN: Gisle Vanem made the win32 version handle a
	  missing CHARSET environment and then figure it out with a
	  suitable windows call.

2004-04-27 17:13  bagder

	* lib/hostthre.c: outputed elsewhere already

2004-04-27 16:22  bagder

	* CHANGES: idn stuff in code and configure script

2004-04-27 16:22  bagder

	* RELEASE-NOTES: we released yesterday, we have heaps of new stuff
	  today! :-)

2004-04-27 16:17  bagder

	* lib/inet_ntop.c: provide our own inet_ntoa_r() proto if the
	  system has none on its own

2004-04-27 15:56  bagder

	* lib/: connect.c, ftp.c, hostares.c, hostthre.c, http.c,
	  http_negotiate.c, ldap.c, ssluse.c, transfer.c, url.c, urldata.h:
	  Made host name and proxy name get stored in a 'struct hostname'
	  and set all things up to work with encoded host names internally,
	  as well as keeping 'display names' to show in debug messages. IDN
	  resolves work for me now using ipv6, ipv4 and ares resolving.
	  Even cookies on IDN sites seem to do right.

2004-04-27 14:08  bagder

	* configure.ac: without-libidn works too now

2004-04-27 13:16  bagder

	* CHANGES: hugehelp.c fix, without-ssl fix

2004-04-27 12:59  bagder

	* tests/libtest/lib504.c: make the loop use a fixed number of
	  attempts to prevent eternal loops

2004-04-27 09:05  bagder

	* docs/libcurl/: Makefile.am, curl_easy_strerror.3,
	  curl_multi_strerror.3, curl_share_strerror.3, index.html,
	  libcurl-errors.3: added curl_*_strerror

2004-04-27 09:05  bagder

	* docs/index.html: added doctype tag to get HTML compliant

2004-04-27 00:13  bagder

	* configure.ac: We now make sure to only scan for SSL options with
	  pkg-config if we haven't disabled SSL with --without-ssl. This
	  previously made the Makefiles use the SSL libs even though told
	  not to.

2004-04-26 23:15  bagder

	* src/: Makefile.am, mkhelp.pl: Include "setup.h" and not
	  "config.h" since setup.h is made to include the correct config.h
	  for the platform, and when this is done the USE_MANUAL define is
	  properly known.

2004-04-26 23:12  bagder

	* docs/curl.1: my nroff 1.18.1 complained the URL as it contains a
	  nroff combo somehow and when I modified it slightly the warning
	  dissappeared...

2004-04-26 22:41  bagder

	* lib/Makefile.vc6: oops, .obj not .c!

2004-04-26 17:31  bagder

	* configure.ac: improved libidn detection to correct the false
	  positives we got

2004-04-26 17:19  bagder

	* lib/url.c: made the verbose connect use the proper host name
	  string even when using a proxy

2004-04-26 17:14  bagder

	* lib/url.c: NI_MAXHOST is not generally available, we use plain
	  256 bytes for the hostname instead, its only for debug verbose
	  output anyway

2004-04-26 17:11  bagder

	* lib/hostip6.c: corrected mistake

2004-04-26 16:18  bagder

	* lib/hostthre.c: Gisle fixed a mistaken check

2004-04-26 16:18  bagder

	* lib/: connect.c, ftp.c, hostip.c, hostip.h, url.c: Made defines
	  instead of plain numbers for the Curl_resolv() return code to
	  make the code easier to read

2004-04-26 16:06  bagder

	* include/curl/: curl.h, types.h: typedef CURL in the curl.h file
	  instead of only having a single useful typedef in the separate
	  types.h

2004-04-26 16:03  bagder

	* lib/: hostip6.c, hostthre.c, http.c, url.c, urldata.h: IDN
	  adjustments and host cleanups by Gisle

2004-04-26 16:02  bagder

	* lib/transfer.c: no longer include curl/types.h, it serves no
	  purpose

2004-04-26 16:02  bagder

	* lib/content_encoding.c: ignore the curl/types.h header file

2004-04-26 15:42  bagder

	* configure.ac: Moved down the ares check again to the bottom of
	  the script since it modified the compiler and link options so
	  nothing can be tested for after this check, as the c-ares lib
	  might not have been built yet!

2004-04-26 14:33  bagder

	* lib/Makefile.vc6: added the new files to the build

2004-04-26 14:29  bagder

	* CHANGES, configure.ac: "configure summary"

2004-04-26 14:04  bagder

	* tests/data/: test400, test401, test402, test403: Removed the FTPS
	  test cases, they only annoy us as they don't work for anyone
	  anywhere. We need to write a better ftps-server for test purposes
	  and then we can re-introduced FTPS tests.

2004-04-26 14:02  bagder

	* lib/: hostip.h, hostip4.c: Curl_ip2addr() now takes an in_addr_t
	  argument instead to prevent compiler warnings

2004-04-26 13:56  bagder

	* lib/hostares.c: removed assignment of variable never used

2004-04-26 13:52  bagder

	* lib/ssluse.c: Tor Arntsen fixed a 'Statement not
	  reachable'-warning

2004-04-26 11:28  bagder

	* docs/libcurl/libcurl-errors.3: Kim Karlsson pointed out that
	  error 57 was wrongly documented

2004-04-26 09:50  bagder

	* lib/telnet.c: TommyTam made a patch to handle stdin redirection
	  for win32.

2004-04-26 09:47  bagder

	* TODO-RELEASE: some fixed, one removed, edited some. 7.12.0 in
	  progress.

2004-04-26 09:26  bagder

	* CHANGES: the recent commits explained

2004-04-26 09:20  bagder

	* lib/: Makefile.am, hostares.c, hostasyn.c, hostip.c, hostip.h,
	  hostip4.c, hostip6.c, hostsyn.c, hostthre.c, inet_ntop.c,
	  inet_ntop.h, memdebug.h, multi.c, setup.h, url.c, url.h,
	  urldata.h: Major hostip.c cleanup and split into multiple files
	  and easier #ifdef usage.

2004-04-26 09:14  bagder

	* src/main.c: supports showing "IDN" as a libcurl feature, now
	  outputs the features in alphabetical order

2004-04-26 09:14  bagder

	* lib/version.c: added libidn awareness

2004-04-26 09:12  bagder

	* lib/file.c: added comments

2004-04-26 09:11  bagder

	* lib/: connect.c, easy.c: added function headers and comments

2004-04-26 09:08  bagder

	* configure.ac: --with-libidn[=PATH] is now supported

2004-04-26 09:04  bagder

	* include/curl/: curl.h, curlver.h: the next release is planned to
	  become 7.12.0

2004-04-26 09:03  bagder

	* RELEASE-NOTES: start all over again

2004-04-26 08:05  bagder

	* CHANGES: 7.11.2 coming today

2004-04-25 17:23  bagder

	* configure.ac: updated the warning text when SSL is explicitly
	  disabled

2004-04-25 17:21  bagder

	* src/: config-amigaos.h, config-mac.h, config-netware.h,
	  config-riscos.h, config-vms.h, config-win32.h: USE_MANUAL is now
	  defined by default

2004-04-25 10:33  bagder

	* CHANGES, CHANGES.2003: moved older changes to the CHANGES.2003
	  file

2004-04-25 10:19  bagder

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES: disable-manual

2004-04-25 10:13  bagder

	* src/: Makefile.am, mkhelp.pl: make the generated hugehelp.c file
	  use the USE_MANUAL define so that it will be properly built with
	  configure --disable-manual even if the source file is already
	  present

2004-04-24 11:33  bagder

	* tests/data/: Makefile.am, test164: test164 HTTP range with
	  multiple ranges

2004-04-23 16:10  bagder

	* RELEASE-NOTES: removed a memory leak when doing a windows
	  threaded resolve and it failed

2004-04-23 16:04  bagder

	* CHANGES, lib/hostip.c:  Gisle Vanem found and fixed a memory leak
	  when doing (failing) Windows
	   threaded name resolves.

2004-04-23 13:00  bagder

	* lib/formdata.c: only a minor comment/format change

2004-04-23 12:37  bagder

	* lib/: formdata.c, formdata.h, http.c: Replaced
	  Curl_FormReadOneLine with Curl_formpostheader as that is the only
	  use for it. It saves one extra copy of the header.

	  I also added comments for several functions in formdata.c

2004-04-23 10:50  bagder

	* RELEASE-NOTES:  o --proxy-ntlm now checks if libcurl supports
	  NTLM before using it
	   o minor --fail with authentication bugfix

2004-04-23 10:47  bagder

	* CHANGES: --proxy-ntlm fix and test case 163

2004-04-23 10:44  bagder

	* src/main.c: Made --proxy-ntlm check if the underlying library
	  actually supports NTLM

2004-04-23 10:40  bagder

	* tests/data/test9: minor format fix

2004-04-23 10:40  bagder

	* tests/data/: Makefile.am, test163: added test 163 - a simple test
	  case that use -F field<file, to verify that we can pass on "odd"
	  characters (newline, CR, tab) like this.

2004-04-23 10:38  bagder

	* tests/runtests.pl: No longer uses the valgrind option
	  '--logfile-fd', we use the --logfile option instead (even though
	  it appends the pid to the file name, making it harder to figure
	  out its name to parse it after a test has run).

	  Also made sure we only use valgrind for the actual test command
	  command lines, not when for example running curl to detect if
	  there are any already running servers are present etc.

2004-04-23 08:29  bagder

	* include/curl/curl.h: define the obsolete options to different
	  values to prevent "duplicate case" situtations in bindings that
	  still have switch() cases for them

2004-04-23 08:04  bagder

	* tests/data/test162: require SSL as otherwise NTLM doesn't work!

2004-04-22 23:27  bagder

	* lib/http.c: missing brace

2004-04-22 22:09  bagder

	* CHANGES: allow newlines in the contents when doing -F
	  "var=[contents]" Robert Marlow reported.

2004-04-22 22:07  bagder

	* CHANGES, lib/http.c, lib/transfer.c, lib/urldata.h,
	  tests/data/Makefile.am, tests/data/test162: - David Byron found
	  and fixed a small bug with the --fail and authentication   stuff
	  added a few weeks ago.  Turns out that if you specify
	  --proxy-ntlm and   communicate with a proxy that requires basic
	  authentication, the proxy   properly returns a 407, but the
	  failure detection code doesn't realize it   should give up, so
	  curl returns with exit code 0. Test case 162 verifies   this.

2004-04-22 17:26  bagder

	* src/main.c: allow newlines in the contents when doing -F
	  "var=[contents]"

2004-04-22 15:15  bagder

	* lib/ftp.h: removed Curl_ftp_quit() as it was turned into a static
	  in ftp.c

2004-04-22 15:10  bagder

	* CHANGES: If a transfer is found out to be only partial, libcurl
	  will now treat that as a problem serious enough to skip the final
	  QUIT command before closing the control connection. To avoid the
	  risk that it will "hang" waiting for the QUIT response. Added
	  test case 161 to verify this.

2004-04-22 15:09  bagder

	* lib/ftp.c, tests/memanalyze.pl, tests/data/Makefile.am,
	  tests/data/test161: If only a partial file was transfered, we
	  consider that a fatal problem so we won't try to QUIT the control
	  connection and risk "hanging" waiting for a response. Test case
	  161 verifies this. The quit-sending function was also made
	  static.

2004-04-22 14:35  bagder

	* lib/http.c: Added comments

2004-04-22 12:33  bagder

	* tests/runtests.pl: modified how valgrind is run to make sure that
	  file handle 3 exists when we tell valgrind to use that to send
	  the logfile to

2004-04-22 10:54  bagder

	* README, RELEASE-NOTES: danish mirror

2004-04-21 21:35  bagder

	* TODO-RELEASE: Gisle's items

2004-04-21 13:18  bagder

	* lib/hostip.c: include unistd.h as well for the close() proto on
	  some platforms (like Tru64)

2004-04-21 13:15  bagder

	* lib/getdate.y: typecast the tolower() argument to an int to
	  prevent compiler warning

2004-04-21 13:15  bagder

	* lib/url.c: typecast tolower/toupper arguments to int to make
	  picky compilers complain less

2004-04-21 10:56  bagder

	* CHANGES, TODO-RELEASE: test case 160 "should work" now

2004-04-21 10:49  bagder

	* lib/: sendf.c, transfer.c, urldata.h: Fix the "lingering close"
	  problem when re-using a connection, as test case 160 shows.

	  We got no data and we attempted to re-use a connection. This
	  might happen if the connection was left alive when we were done
	  using it before, but that was closed when we wanted to read from
	  it again. Bad luck. Retry the same request on a fresh connect!

	  Deleted the sockerror variable again, it serves no purpose
	  anymore.

2004-04-21 10:47  bagder

	* lib/ftp.c: increase the headerbytecount for incoming "headers"

2004-04-21 08:56  bagder

	* tests/server/sws.c: log the WAIT command

2004-04-20 11:46  bagder

	* lib/hostip.c: cleanup leftovers

2004-04-20 10:35  bagder

	* tests/data/: Makefile.am, test160: test160 - for a more
	  controlled testing of the case where libcurl starts to re-use a
	  connection that is closed when re-used and libcurl should then
	  make a new fresh connection and use instead

2004-04-20 09:53  bagder

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES, lib/ftp.c, lib/http.c, lib/ssluse.c,
	  lib/transfer.c, lib/url.c, lib/urldata.h: Cleaned up
	  hostname/name/gname and path/ppath confusion. Removed the fixed-
	  length limit of the hostname part of the URL.

2004-04-20 09:52  bagder

	* README: new mirror and one that changed domain

2004-04-20 09:36  bagder

	* tests/data/test91: make the first response get a "connection:
	  close" header as that is how most 1.1 connections will be closed.
	  The case where it gets closed anyway is subject for a new
	  separate test.

2004-04-19 17:20  bagder

	* tests/ftpserver.pl: changed the logging to work when the logfile
	  is removed during testing

2004-04-19 10:41  bagder

	* tests/data/: test154, test88: Make the server include
	  "Connection: close" in the headers of the replies it actually
	  will close. This is after all what HTTP 1.1 says a server should
	  do.

2004-04-19 09:18  bagder

	* lib/progress.c: Gisle Vanem corrected a mistake in a recent
	  progress fix

2004-04-17 13:38  bagder

	* tests/server/sws.c: Gisle Vanem: patches to make sws.c compile
	  under MingW/MSVC is attached. And some cosmetic fixes.

2004-04-17 13:33  bagder

	* lib/connect.c: Gisle made a failed connect output the reason for
	  it

2004-04-17 13:33  bagder

	* lib/setup.h: NDEBUG should not be defined when CURLDEBUG is

2004-04-16 09:33  bagder

	* TODO-RELEASE: adding issue 36 to be fixed before release

2004-04-16 09:02  bagder

	* tests/runtests.pl: don't display the . and .. files when dumping
	  the log/ contents

2004-04-16 09:01  bagder

	* tests/server/sws.c: remade the logging function to better deal
	  with removed logfiles during the execution of the tests

2004-04-15 17:05  bagder

	* TODO-RELEASE: issue 31 - fix windows multi interface is now
	  corrected

2004-04-15 17:05  bagder

	* docs/libcurl/curl_multi_fdset.3: clarified that select() timeouts
	  should always remain rather short

2004-04-15 16:53  bagder

	* CHANGES: my test suite edits

2004-04-15 15:55  bagder

	* tests/ftpserver.pl: change the log format to look similar to sws
	  added various logging info

2004-04-15 15:37  bagder

	* tests/runtests.pl: clean the log directory between each single
	  test, so that we can better display all logs and only logs with
	  relevant data when a test fails and -p is used.

2004-04-15 12:43  bagder

	* lib/ftp.c: ftp->dirs[] is no longer terminated with a zero entry
	  but ftp->dirdepth should be used

2004-04-15 09:52  bagder

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES, lib/ftp.c, lib/urldata.h,
	  tests/data/test142: removed the fixed dir depth limit in the FTP
	  code

2004-04-14 14:13  bagder

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES: two ipresolve fixes

2004-04-14 14:13  bagder

	* docs/libcurl/curl_multi_fdset.3: format fix

2004-04-14 14:10  bagder

	* lib/hostip.c: asking for CURL_IPRESOLVE_V6 when ipv6 addresses
	  can't be resolved will now cause the resolve function to return
	  NULL immediately

2004-04-14 14:00  bagder

	* src/main.c: Gisle Vanem made the -4/-6 actually get set too

2004-04-14 13:43  bagder

	* lib/hostip.c: Curl_wait_for_resolv() could hang due to the bad
	  timeout timer resolution and some bad thinking on my part.

2004-04-14 09:07  bagder

	* CHANGES: several changes

2004-04-14 09:04  bagder

	* tests/runtests.pl: display interesting log files on failure, if
	  -p is used

2004-04-14 08:53  bagder

	* tests/libtest/lib511.c: enable verbose as well

2004-04-14 08:30  bagder

	* tests/: data/Makefile.am, data/test511, libtest/Makefile.am,
	  libtest/lib511.c: Added test case 511 in an attempt to repeat bug
	  report #934666 "storage leak in ftp.c", but it shows no leaking.

2004-04-13 16:34  bagder

	* docs/libcurl/curl_multi_fdset.3: minor format fix

2004-04-13 16:31  bagder

	* docs/libcurl/curl_multi_fdset.3: eh, these can't be used for
	  poll()! ;-)

2004-04-13 16:27  bagder

	* docs/libcurl/: curl_multi_add_handle.3, curl_multi_cleanup.3,
	  libcurl-errors.3: additional info

2004-04-13 15:59  bagder

	* lib/hostip.c: Gisle Vanem's fix that makes the multi interface
	  work on Windows again even when not using ares.

2004-04-13 13:03  bagder

	* RELEASE-NOTES: spell fixes

2004-04-13 12:58  bagder

	* RELEASE-NOTES: more news

2004-04-13 12:42  bagder

	* lib/url.c: proper typecast to prevent compiler warning

2004-04-13 11:08  bagder

	* docs/libcurl/: curl_easy_duphandle.3, curl_easy_init.3: removed
	  the BUGS section since it offers nothing good

2004-04-13 09:44  bagder

	* ares/CHANGES: 1.2.0

2004-04-13 09:37  bagder

	* lib/: http.c, transfer.c, url.c, urldata.h: remove an long time
	  #defined struct member and use the actual "real" name instead to
	  make it easier to find/read

2004-04-13 09:16  bagder

	* lib/: connect.c, url.c, urldata.h: Moved the 'tcp_nodelay' member
	  to the proper 'UserDefined' struct within the sessionhandle to
	  make the duphandle() function work as supposed. Also tried to
	  start document functions the doxygen way (in the headers of the
	  functions).  Can't make it work though...

2004-04-13 08:13  bagder

	* TODO-RELEASE: move issue 35 (hostip.c cleanup) forward, I don't
	  feel like doing that now

2004-04-13 07:58  bagder

	* tests/Makefile.am: full-test passes -p to runtests as well to get
	  more details in case of failure

2004-04-13 07:57  bagder

	* tests/runtests.pl: Initial support for dumping the contents of
	  the files in log/ when failing when -p is used. For easier
	  bug-hunting of autobuild failures. This still only shows what
	  files that are present in log/, as I believe we need to filter
	  which files we show on a failure.

2004-04-12 08:55  bagder

	* lib/hostip.c: somewhat safer typecasting in case sizeof(long) !=
	  sizeof(void *) (is there even such platforms?)

2004-04-11 22:25  bagder

	* lib/Makefile.vc6: David Byron's patch for MSVC builds with zlib

2004-04-11 08:33  bagder

	* ares/FILES: updated to not include the msvc-generated files

2004-04-11 08:32  bagder

	* ares/buildconf: when checked out from CVS, run this to generate
	  the proper scripts

2004-04-09 11:36  bagder

	* lib/: progress.c, timeval.c, timeval.h: Dirk Manske increased the
	  resolution for what the CURLINFO_*_TIME return.

2004-04-08 20:10  bagder

	* ares/ares_version.h: we're working on 1.2.0 now

2004-04-07 17:01  bagder

	* tests/data/: Makefile.am, test159: added test 159, use --ntlm
	  together with -0

2004-04-07 16:27  bagder

	* CHANGES, README, RELEASE-NOTES, docs/KNOWN_BUGS, lib/http.c,
	  lib/transfer.c, lib/urldata.h, tests/data/Makefile.am,
	  tests/data/test158: getting only a 100 Continue response and
	  nothing else, when talking HTTP, is now treated as an error by
	  libcurl

2004-04-07 16:03  bagder

	* docs/KNOWN_BUGS: --limit-rate using -d or -F does not work

2004-04-07 09:30  bagder

	* lib/Makefile.am, lib/README.curlx, lib/ftp.c, lib/strtoofft.h,
	  lib/transfer.c, src/main.c: renamed the strtoofft() macro to
	  curlx_strtoofft() to adjust to the curlx_* concept, and added
	  lib/README.curlx to explain details about it

2004-04-07 09:23  bagder

	* src/main.c: Use curl_off_t for the limit rate values to support
	  REALLY huge values on such platforms that support large files.

2004-04-06 17:30  bagder

	* TODO-RELEASE: mention getting windows builds to work after
	  rearrangements

2004-04-06 17:29  bagder

	* TODO-RELEASE, docs/TODO: Moved long-standing issues over from
	  TODO-RELEASE to the more long-term TODO file.

2004-04-06 17:22  bagder

	* TODO-RELEASE: the memory leak on windows have been addressed

2004-04-06 17:16  bagder

	* tests/data/test155: require ssl since ntlm needs it

2004-04-06 17:14  bagder

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES, lib/file.c, lib/ftp.c, lib/http.c,
	  lib/transfer.c, lib/url.c, lib/urldata.h, tests/data/test154,
	  tests/data/test155, tests/data/test156, tests/data/test157,
	  tests/data/test88: New authentication code added, particularly
	  noticable when doing POST or PUT with Digest or NTLM. libcurl
	  will now use HEAD to negotiate the authentication and when done
	  perform the requested POST.

2004-04-06 17:12  bagder

	* ares/CHANGES: mention the man page updates from the other day

2004-04-06 17:09  bagder

	* lib/hostip.c: the pack_hostent() proto isn't used/needed with
	  ipv6 is enabled.

	  time to restructure this source file!

2004-04-06 16:51  bagder

	* lib/hostip.c: Gisle Vanem's fix for bug item #927979 reported by
	  Nathan O'Sullivan.

	  Good enough?

2004-04-06 16:07  bagder

	* lib/Makefile.am: Added the curl source header and changed some
	  comments

2004-04-06 14:06  bagder

	* CHANGES, src/Makefile.am, src/main.c: improved --limit-rate
	  functionality, partly by the new use of curlx_tvnow()

2004-04-06 14:02  bagder

	* lib/strerror.c: Gisle Vanem caught me breaking the windows
	  version of Curl_strerror()

2004-04-06 12:15  bagder

	* lib/: timeval.c, timeval.h: provide these functions as curlx_*
	  ones as this enables the curl app to re-use these sources and
	  functions for subsecond resolution timing

2004-04-06 09:59  bagder

	* lib/README.ares: up-to-date with reality

2004-04-06 09:49  bagder

	* src/config.h.in: added HAVE_GETTIMEOFDAY, we need it for better
	  time resolution

2004-04-06 09:48  bagder

	* src/urlglob.c: typecasts to please picky compilers checking the
	  printf() format string

2004-04-06 08:24  bagder

	* RELEASE-NOTES: one change, three bugs, one credit

2004-04-06 08:24  bagder

	* CHANGES: the last couple of days

2004-04-06 08:18  bagder

	* TODO-RELEASE: two issues to fix before 7.11.2, one issue to fix
	  befor 7.12.0

2004-04-06 08:06  bagder

	* lib/strerror.c: remove the general use of sys_nerr

2004-04-05 14:38  bagder

	* ares/vc/: vc.ncb, vc.opt: generated files, no need to keep in CVS

2004-04-02 13:04  bagder

	* docs/libcurl/curl_strnequal.3: prepend the man3 dir to the file
	  name to work better.	Robin Kay pointed this out.

2004-04-02 11:56  bagder

	* ares/: ares_gethostbyaddr.3, ares_gethostbyname.3: edits, mainly
	  to make the generated html output nicer

2004-04-02 11:50  bagder

	* ares/: ares_destroy.3, ares_free_hostent.3, ares_mkquery.3,
	  ares_process.3, ares_timeout.3: minor edits

2004-04-02 09:32  bagder

	* lib/progress.c: Dirk Manske's feedback: * bring back subsecond
	  resolution to CURLINFO_TOTAL_TIME * Fix the Curl_pgrsDone() so
	  that the final progress update is shown properly

2004-04-02 09:18  bagder

	* lib/Makefile.m32, src/Makefile.m32: Andrs Garca's updated mingw
	  makefiles

2004-04-02 08:40  bagder

	* docs/examples/multi-single.c: if select returns -1, bail out of
	  the loop

2004-04-01 12:26  bagder

	* configure.ac: Only check that the c-ares lib is valid if we don't
	  use the "embedded" directory. The provided ares dir is probably
	  up-to-date, but more importantly it is often not built yet at the
	  time when this configure script runs.

2004-04-01 11:10  bagder

	* configure.ac: When ares is enabled, we now check for the
	  ares_cancel function to verify that we use a library that is
	  recent enough to build with the latest libcurl.

2004-04-01 10:40  bagder

	* lib/hostip.c: Dirk Manske's fix that makes sure we cancel the
	  ares resolve when we time out from a name resolve. Without this,
	  we leak memory!

2004-04-01 10:25  bagder

	* ares/: CHANGES, Makefile.in, ares.h, ares_cancel.3,
	  ares_cancel.c: Dirk Manske's ares_cancel() function was added.

2004-04-01 10:25  bagder

	* ares/README.cares: edited slightly, point out our new mailinglist

2004-04-01 10:23  bagder

	* ares/maketgz: remind us about cvs tagging when we've built a
	  release archive

2004-04-01 09:04  bagder

	* lib/hostip.c: removed my previously attempted fix for ares
	  timeouts, not needed

2004-04-01 08:53  bagder

	* acinclude.m4: Applied Joe Halpin's bugfixes to the NI_WITHSCOPEID
	  test program.

2004-04-01 08:10  bagder

	* ares/: ares_mkquery.3, ares_parse_a_reply.3,
	  ares_parse_ptr_reply.3, ares_send.3: Dominick Meglio man page
	  fixes

2004-03-31 23:33  bagder

	* lib/: ftp.c, url.c: Use the new HAVE_NI_WITHSCOPEID define
	  instead of merely checking for the existance of NI_WITHSCOPEID
	  since some platforms have that define but still can't function
	  with it set.

2004-03-31 23:04  bagder

	* TODO-RELEASE: issue 30, digest re-negotiate works now!

2004-03-31 23:03  bagder

	* CHANGES: recent changes

2004-03-31 23:01  bagder

	* RELEASE-NOTES: updates and David Byron's spellfix

2004-03-31 22:50  bagder

	* lib/hostip.c: Roy Shan fixed a case that prevented ares name
	  resolve timeouts to occur.

2004-03-31 22:22  bagder

	* include/curl/curlver.h: we're working on 7.11.2-CVS right now

2004-03-31 22:13  bagder

	* acinclude.m4: HAVE_NI_WITHSCOPEID spelled right!

2004-03-31 15:19  bagder

	* lib/hostip.c: Remove the elapsed time from the most recent
	  select() only.

2004-03-31 14:55  bagder

	* lib/hostip.c: The asynch name resolve methods now all use
	  CURL_TIMEOUT_RESOLVE for the specific time to wait for a resolve.
	  The definition is at the top of this source file.

2004-03-31 14:45  bagder

	* lib/hostip.c: Dirk Manske found out the Curl_wait_for_resolv()
	  timed out too early.

2004-03-31 14:24  bagder

	* tests/FILEFORMAT: added swsbounce

2004-03-31 13:55  bagder

	* lib/http_digest.c: added include to fix warning

2004-03-31 13:55  bagder

	* lib/http_digest.c: * Fixed a memory leak when doing repeated
	  re-negotiations.  * Made the incoming line parser more forgiving
	  to allow "name=contents" pairs where the contents isn't within
	  double quotes.  * Made the digest code return CURLDIGEST_BADALGO
	  if a requested algorithm isn't supported by the code.

2004-03-31 13:51  bagder

	* tests/data/: Makefile.am, test153: test 153 tests Digest
	  authorization and stale=true stuff

2004-03-31 13:50  bagder

	* tests/server/sws.c: Added "swsbounce" magic: if this keyword is
	  present in a <data> section it sets the "swsbounce" magic mode.
	  If there follows a request for the SAME test number and the SAME
	  part number, this mode will make the server bump the part number
	  internally and thus return a different <dataNUM> section than it
	  otherwise would.

	  Test case 153 uses this in case you need an example. It is pretty
	  involved and hard-to-use, but then the situation is pretty
	  special over all. Enjoy.

2004-03-31 12:59  bagder

	* lib/ftp.c: Moved the NI_WITHSCOPEID magic #ifdef to the top of
	  the file and made sure we use the NIFLAGS properly on both places
	  in the code that use getnameinfo().

2004-03-31 12:46  bagder

	* lib/url.c, tests/data/test63: Fixed how the user name is
	  extracted from http_proxy environment variable when set.

2004-03-31 12:34  bagder

	* acinclude.m4, lib/connect.c: Andrs Garca fixed a warning in the
	  ioctlsocket() usage.

2004-03-31 12:31  bagder

	* acinclude.m4: modified the NI_WITHSCOPEID to use an AF_INET6
	  socket immediately and added some more debug output to make it
	  easier to detect failure reasons in the autobuild logs

2004-03-31 11:20  bagder

	* lib/http_digest.h: CURLDIGEST_BADALGO is a new return code from
	  the digest code

2004-03-31 08:10  bagder

	* ares/ares_strerror.c: Dominick Meglio fixed a missing comma

2004-03-30 17:35  bagder

	* docs/KNOWN_BUGS: one issue less

2004-03-30 15:05  bagder

	* lib/connect.c: typecast setsockopt()'s 4th argument to void * to
	  make compilers complain less

2004-03-30 15:02  bagder

	* lib/: easy.c, hostip.h, http.c, multi.c, share.c: adjusted to the
	  new dns cache function to hide more hostip internals

2004-03-30 15:02  bagder

	* lib/hostip.c: Lots of comments added an clarified. Added timeout
	  for the ares version of Curl_is_resolved() to address Roy Shan's
	  reported problem.

2004-03-30 15:00  bagder

	* lib/urldata.h: added stale boolean to the digest struct

2004-03-30 15:00  bagder

	* lib/http_digest.c: first attempt to support stale=true

2004-03-30 12:35  bagder

	* acinclude.m4, configure.ac: Added CURL_CHECK_NI_WITHSCOPEID that
	  checks if NI_WITHSCOPEID exists and works. No code actually uses
	  the HAVE_NI_WITHSCOPEID (that a positive test results in), but
	  this is still only for testing purposes.

2004-03-30 11:06  bagder

	* ares/: CHANGES, Makefile.in, ares.h, ares_expand_string.3,
	  ares_expand_string.c, ares_free_string.3, ares_strerror.c:
	  Dominick Meglio's new ares_expand_string() function

2004-03-30 10:28  bagder

	* buildconf: when checking the automake version, cut off trailing
	  "-p[whatever]" from the version string before doing the version
	  number checks.

2004-03-30 10:21  bagder

	* lib/http.c: if 0'ed out a code section that uses __FUNCTION__
	  etc, used for debugging the new "fail with auth" code

2004-03-30 10:14  bagder

	* lib/multi.c: init the dns pointer to NULL for clarity

2004-03-30 10:11  bagder

	* lib/timeval.c: added more comments for what the functions return

2004-03-30 08:46  bagder

	* docs/SSLCERTS: mention the fact that you can append a new CA cert
	  to the existing bundle too

2004-03-30 08:42  bagder

	* CHANGES: David Byron's patch was appplied to make
	  CURLOPT_FAILONERROR work nicely even with authentcations such as
	  NTLM or Digest enabled. Test cases 150, 151 and 152 were added to
	  verify the functionality.

2004-03-30 08:41  bagder

	* tests/data/: Makefile.am, test150, test151, test152: David
	  Byron's new test cases for the --fail and auth stuff.

2004-03-30 08:40  bagder

	* lib/: http.c, http.h, transfer.c: David Byron made
	  CURLOPT_FAILONERROR work with authentications such as NTLM or
	  Digest.

2004-03-30 08:39  bagder

	* lib/: http_ntlm.c, http_ntlm.h: 'authdone' was added to the
	  sessionhandle and thus was removed from the argument to the NTLM
	  function(s)

2004-03-30 08:38  bagder

	* lib/urldata.h: David Byron added 'authdone' to the SessionHandle.

2004-03-30 00:45  bagder

	* src/: curlmsg.h, curlmsg.msg, curlmsg.sdl, curlmsg_vms.h: these
	  are now in the packages/vms dir

2004-03-29 23:29  bagder

	* lib/hostip.c: The select() timeout is better not static since
	  some implementation actually might change it. I don't *think* it
	  does it when the timeout is 0,0 but it is better to be sure...

2004-03-29 15:46  bagder

	* TODO-RELEASE: issue 24 is fixed by making sure the time fields
	  use a static width

2004-03-29 15:46  bagder

	* RELEASE-NOTES: several noticable recent changes

2004-03-29 15:45  bagder

	* CHANGES: changes changes changes

2004-03-29 14:38  bagder

	* tests/Makefile.am: All test targets now run 'make all' before
	  they prcoeed with the actual testing so that all test files are
	  build first properly. David Byron reported.

2004-03-29 14:29  bagder

	* lib/config.dj, lib/makefile.dj, packages/DOS/README,
	  packages/DOS/common.dj, src/main.c, src/makefile.dj,
	  src/writeenv.c: Gisle Vanem's djgpp/MS-DOS updates

2004-03-29 11:26  bagder

	* tests/runtests.pl: fix to figure out the "real" windows path when
	  built and run with mingw Andrs Garca helped out!

2004-03-29 09:25  bagder

	* lib/strerror.c: re-indented to use curl-standard source
	  formatting

2004-03-29 08:22  bagder

	* configure.ac, lib/connect.c: netinet/tcp.h may require
	  netinet/in.h to be include before

2004-03-28 23:41  bagder

	* docs/examples/postit2.c: use the correct struct

2004-03-27 12:15  bagder

	* lib/connect.c: Tor fixed a left-over from the ip argument to
	  setnodelay

2004-03-26 14:47  bagder

	* lib/setup.h: Gisle Vanem:

	  A patch to bypass MS' sillyness with regard to IPv6 and
	  getaddrinfo().

	  The CURLDEBUG part is to avoid redefinition warning caused by
	  memdebug.h. If ENABLE_IPV6 isn't enabled, it doesn't matter since
	  we never call getaddrinfo(). Allthough we could to support weird
	  protocols like SOCK_RDM that Win-2K/XP has.

2004-03-26 14:20  bagder

	* docs/MANUAL: some more password blurb

2004-03-26 08:10  bagder

	* configure.ac, lib/connect.c: check for netinet/tcp.h precense
	  before actually including it

2004-03-26 08:03  bagder

	* lib/connect.c: removed the ip number from the notcpdelay function

2004-03-25 17:03  bagder

	* configure.ac: get the version number from the new curlver.h
	  header file

2004-03-25 16:48  bagder

	* configure.ac: localtime and gmtime are not thread-safe on newer
	  AIXes either so we force a check for there *_r-versions too

2004-03-25 16:10  bagder

	* configure.ac: force recent AIX versions to check for strerror_r

2004-03-25 15:01  bagder

	* lib/connect.c: only output one line about the nodelay even if it
	  fails

2004-03-25 14:43  bagder

	* lib/strerror.c: win32 doesn't need and even doesn't build if we
	  extern declare sys_nerr

2004-03-25 14:42  bagder

	* lib/: connect.c, ftp.c, strerror.c: include the strerror.h file
	  without curl_ prefix

2004-03-25 14:40  bagder

	* lib/Makefile.vc6: strerror without prefix

2004-03-25 14:40  bagder

	* lib/: Makefile.am, curl_strerror.c, curl_strerror.h, strerror.c,
	  strerror.h: cut off 'curl_' from the strerror file names

2004-03-25 14:37  bagder

	* docs/curl.1, docs/libcurl/curl_easy_setopt.3,
	  include/curl/curl.h, lib/connect.c, lib/url.c, lib/urldata.h,
	  src/main.c: tcp-nodelay patch by Joe Halpin

2004-03-25 13:45  bagder

	* lib/curl_strerror.c: so there are at least two different
	  strerror_r() versions and our brand new configure script detects
	  them and now this code acts according to what API that was
	  detected

2004-03-25 13:16  bagder

	* tests/testcurl.pl: Tor Arntsen fixed how this is invoked

2004-03-25 13:15  bagder

	* acinclude.m4: strerror_r() detection changes: 1. Try with
	  _THREAD_SAFE instead of _REENTRANT, as AIX seems to require it
	  and if _REENTRANT is required we should already have it set since
	  one of    the previous tests.  2. Added API-detection for what
	  kind of strerror_r() that is provided. The	POSIX style or the
	  glibc style.

	  Tor Arntsen provided the necessary feedback these changes are
	  based upon.

2004-03-25 12:39  bagder

	* tests/testcurl.pl: detect daily snapshots using the new path for
	  this test

2004-03-25 12:34  bagder

	* include/curl/Makefile.am: make clean now removes *dist files too
	  that might be leftovers from 'maketgz'

2004-03-25 09:22  bagder

	* tests/testcurl.pl: invoke this script via env, as it is more
	  likely to exist at a fixed path while perl often is installed in
	  /usr/local/bin or elsewhere

2004-03-25 08:53  bagder

	* lib/Makefile.vc6: added curl_strerror to the build

2004-03-25 08:52  bagder

	* lib/curl_strerror.c: extern declare the sys_nerr variable.
	  Required on Solaris at least.

	* lib/curl_strerror.c: Always include setup.h as the first header
	  file.  Added a more verbose comment about what strerror_r() can
	  set errno to in case of failure.  This file still doesn't build
	  on Solaris due to a missing 'sys_nerr' symbol.

2004-03-24 23:53  bagder

	* include/curl/: curl.h, multi.h: Added protos for the upcoming
	  curl_*_strerror() functions

2004-03-24 23:46  bagder

	* lib/Makefile.am: missed the new header file

2004-03-24 23:45  bagder

	* lib/: Makefile.am, connect.c, curl_strerror.c, ftp.c, urldata.h:
	  Gisle Vanem's fix to replace the bad use of strerror(). This
	  introduces Curl_strerror() that attempts to be thread-safe _and_
	  works on Windows too!

2004-03-24 23:43  bagder

	* lib/curl_strerror.h: new header file - for Curl_strerror()

2004-03-24 23:24  bagder

	* curl-style.el: better comments, added some more variable types we
	  use in the font-lock

2004-03-24 22:40  bagder

	* docs/libcurl/: curl_easy_getinfo.3, curl_easy_init.3,
	  curl_easy_setopt.3, curl_formadd.3, curl_getdate.3,
	  curl_mprintf.3, curl_multi_info_read.3, curl_multi_init.3,
	  curl_multi_perform.3, curl_share_init.3, libcurl-easy.3,
	  libcurl-errors.3, libcurl-multi.3, libcurl.3: Tor Arntsen's major
	  ispell patch

2004-03-24 22:28  bagder

	* tests/testcurl.pl: Tor Arntsen's mkdir-fix to make this run with
	  perl 5.0005

2004-03-24 11:52  bagder

	* tests/testcurl.pl: Avoid doing chdir .., as it breaks the ability
	  to use symlinks properly.  chdir to absolute directory names
	  instead. (this flaw exists in the shell version too)

2004-03-24 09:45  bagder

	* acinclude.m4, configure.ac: added check for strerror_r()

2004-03-24 08:27  bagder

	* src/version.h: include curl/curlver.h instead since this only
	  needs the version defines

2004-03-23 17:12  bagder

	* CHANGES: error messages and new test script

2004-03-23 17:12  bagder

	* RELEASE-NOTES: we are progressing

2004-03-23 17:11  bagder

	* tests/Makefile.am: distribute testcurl.pl too starting now

2004-03-23 17:07  bagder

	* tests/testcurl.pl: Greg Hewgill's version of testcurl.sh
	  rewritten in perl for greater portability. I put it in this
	  directory instead of the root since I think perhaps it makes more
	  sense.

2004-03-23 17:01  bagder

	* lib/urldata.h: keep current_speed as an curl_off_t for better
	  precision at higher speeds if large file support is available

2004-03-23 16:48  bagder

	* lib/connect.c: switch() on the right variable!

2004-03-23 16:30  bagder

	* lib/netrc.c: curl_strequal() returns int, keep return variables
	  in an int

2004-03-23 16:28  bagder

	* lib/telnet.c: make the variables that hold the result of strlen()
	  size_t

2004-03-23 16:25  bagder

	* lib/mprintf.c: stricter variable type usage

2004-03-23 16:20  bagder

	* lib/ssluse.c: variable type usage cleanup to please picky
	  compilers

2004-03-23 16:14  bagder

	* lib/getdate.y: get strlen() results in a size_t, delete
	  'register'

2004-03-23 16:06  bagder

	* lib/progress.c: made time2str() use longs internally instead to
	  prevent compiler warnings when converting to ints

2004-03-23 16:01  bagder

	* lib/progress.c: added explicit typecasts to prevent compiler
	  warnings on variable conversions

2004-03-23 15:43  bagder

	* lib/connect.c: If localbind fails, provide a more portable error
	  message.

2004-03-23 15:34  bagder

2004-03-23 15:29  bagder

	* maketgz: src/version.h was not properly made!

2004-03-23 12:52  bagder

	* CHANGES: progress meter fix, CURLINFO_CONTENT_LENGTH_DOWNLOAD
	  fix, cygwin package fix

2004-03-23 12:46  bagder

	* lib/progress.c: it actually fits to make a NNNd NNh display so
	  this can be used up to 999 days

2004-03-23 12:43  bagder

	* lib/progress.c: Fixed the time fields no never get wider than 8
	  letters. They can now switch to a "days + hours" or even "just
	  days" display if the time value is very large. I also switched
	  several calculations over to fixed-point instead of the previous
	  doubles.

2004-03-23 10:12  bagder

	* src/: urlglob.c, urlglob.h: int/size_t cleanup

2004-03-23 09:50  bagder

	  less

2004-03-23 09:42  bagder

	* ares/ares_gethostbyaddr.c: changed the long to int typecasts to
	  see if icc 8.0 complains less on this

2004-03-22 23:38  bagder

	* lib/transfer.c: Makes CURLINFO_CONTENT_LENGTH_DOWNLOAD work even
	  if CURLOPT_NOBODY is set true.

2004-03-22 23:24  bagder

	* packages/Win32/cygwin/: Makefile.am, README: Kevin Roth's updates
	  to handle a new requirement from the Cygwin folks to package man
	  and doc files in a slightly different location.

2004-03-22 22:46  bagder

	* packages/vms/: ia64/README, vax/README: crap files to get the
	  dirs made when checked out from CVS

2004-03-22 22:42  bagder

	* packages/vms/axp/README: container to get this dir made

2004-03-22 22:37  bagder

	* packages/vms/Makefile.am: Make the axp/README ia64/README
	  vax/README files get included as well.  They're 0-bytes files,
	  but make the dirs get created!

2004-03-22 14:56  bagder

	* TODO-RELEASE: issue 27 fixed, moved libcurl version defines to
	  its own header file

2004-03-22 09:54  bagder

	* lib/libcurl.rc: include the new curlver instead, since all this
	  wants is the version info

2004-03-22 09:37  bagder

	* maketgz, include/curl/Makefile.am, include/curl/curl.h,
	  include/curl/curlver.h: Introducing curl/curlver.h for keeping

2004-03-18 11:03  bagder

	* configure.ac: For IRIX systems we must pick the "correct" lib
	  dirs for the particular libs we want. $libsuff is the magic
	  variable that contains a suffix (which might be blank). Tor
	  Arntsen brought details and verified this fix.

2004-03-17 22:30  bagder

	* lib/curllib.dsp: added http_ntlm.[ch] and inet_pton.[ch], pointed

	  Kuhrt's provided files for the VMS package

2004-03-15 08:47  bagder

	* buildconf: Check for a GNU version of m4, since autoconf won't

2004-03-14 19:15  bagder

	* lib/http.c: fix signed and unsigned warnings

2004-03-13 18:11  bagder

	* lib/http.c: postsize is off_t now, so we typecase it to int
	  before doing normal printf with it (knowing it won't be larger
	  than what fits in an int)

2004-03-13 18:03  bagder

	* lib/http.c: the postsize is an off_t so use the proper printf
	  format to output the content-length when doing multipart posts

2004-03-12 15:22  bagder

	* lib/: formdata.c, formdata.h, http.c: more variable type fixing

	* src/main.c: David Byron's fix to clear outs.filename

2004-03-11 22:51  bagder

	  to double when we return their values

2004-03-11 22:49  bagder

	* TODO-RELEASE: Optimize the way libcurl uses CWD

2004-03-11 22:48  bagder

2004-03-11 14:15  bagder

	* TODO-RELEASE: added that header fiddling the msvc users will
	  enjoy

	* lib/ssluse.c: don't let the EINTR stuff build on windows

2004-03-10 17:20  bagder

	* lib/: file.c, ftp.c, getinfo.c, http.c, progress.c, progress.h,
	  transfer.c, urldata.h: Use more curl_off_t variables when doing
	  the progress meter calculations and argument passing and try to
	  convert to double only when providing data to the external world.

2004-03-10 17:07  bagder

	* src/config-win32.h: use the new OS define from lib/config-win32.h

	  since it is dead and they don't respond to email

2004-03-10 12:28  bagder

2004-03-10 12:28  bagder

	* ares/CHANGES: Gisle Vanem improved build on Windows.

2004-03-10 11:19  bagder

	* lib/setup.h: Nah, ignore the OS define in here. This is being
	  included by ares and it certainly doesn't need the OS define.

2004-03-10 10:52  bagder

	  in unspecified order"

	  remove the extra {} body within the switch.

2004-03-10 10:44  bagder

	* lib/http.c: keep the number of bytes read in a size_t variable

2004-03-10 10:41  bagder

	* lib/cookie.c: strequal() returns int so we typecast the return to
	  bool when we store the result as bool

2004-03-10 10:36  bagder

	* lib/hostip.c: store times in time_t

2004-03-10 09:43  bagder

	* lib/ssluse.c: Jeff Lawson fixed the SSL connection to deal with
	  received signals during the connect.

2004-03-10 09:15  bagder

	* lib/setup.h: Now requires an OS string defined by the config*.h
	  file

2004-03-10 09:14  bagder

	* lib/config-win32.h: make windows builds use the OS string
	  "i386-pc-win32" instead of just "win32" to make it more like
	  other OS strings

2004-03-10 09:12  bagder

	* tests/server/getpart.c: use size_t for string lengths

2004-03-10 09:08  bagder

	* lib/setup.h: Make sure SIZEOF_CURL_OFF_T is defined before we
	  check for it being > 4.  It is only undefined when this file is
	  included by others (like ares) and in those cases it doesn't
	  matter.

2004-03-10 08:04  bagder

	* lib/config-win32.h: removed the #if 0'ed pragmas that disable
	  warnings on msvc

	  sendf.c, sendf.h, setup.h, ssluse.c, ssluse.h, telnet.c,
	  transfer.c, transfer.h, urldata.h: Use curl_socket_t instead of
	  int for holding sockets. The typedefs and defines are in setup.h.

2004-03-09 22:49  bagder

	* tests/server/Makefile.am: Added -I$(top_srcdir)/include, since
	  lib/setup.h might include files from the external curl include
	  dir.

2004-03-09 22:42  bagder

	* lib/hostip.c: only build with the windows threading trace code if
	  DEBUG_THREADING_GETHOSTBYNAME is defined

2004-03-09 22:39  bagder

	* lib/http.c: explicit typecast to visualize that we really want

2004-03-05 10:37  bagder

	* lib/ftp.c: clearly tell that these are ftp response timeouts

2004-03-05 09:32  bagder

	* tests/server/sws.c: Major rewrite of the test HTTP server to

	  sws.log

2004-03-05 09:01  bagder

	* docs/BINDINGS: mention the D binding

2004-03-05 08:55  bagder

	* docs/curl.1: Multiple updates, most of them being proper
	  formatting to create nice html links in the web pages, but also
	  additional facts and removal of old crap.

2004-03-04 17:19  bagder

	* TODO-RELEASE: issue 12 fix is pending and is working in devel
	  added issue 24 - fix the progress meter for large files on slow
	  networks to not wrap

2004-03-04 17:13  bagder

	* lib/multi.c: When following to a new URL, we must make sure to
	  call Curl_done() first, since the current connection must be
	  taken care of properly before we move on. Christopher R. Palmer
	  reported a problem he found due to this mistake.

2004-03-04 16:32  bagder

	* lib/: connect.c, setup.h: Andrs Garca's patch to prevent
	  warnings while compiling with mingw, mainly because it is now
	  possible to have both WIN32 and HAVE_CONFIG_H defined.

2004-03-04 16:25  bagder

	* lib/: http_chunks.c, http_chunks.h: use size_t for the data, but
	  keep the protos use ssize_t to better fit with the existing
	  transfer.c code

2004-03-04 16:23  bagder

	* lib/file.c: include the proper header file too

2004-03-03 14:30  bagder

	* CHANGES: three days of changes

2004-03-03 14:24  bagder

	* lib/ftp.c: more variable type cleanups

2004-03-03 14:17  bagder

	* lib/ftp.c: our timeout values are longs while 'tv_sec' is int

2004-03-03 14:12  bagder

	* lib/urldata.h: make the backup variable of the same kind as the
	  data it backups! ;-)

2004-03-03 14:11  bagder

	* lib/formdata.c: some more size_t usage, and two added typecasts
	  when converting from size_t to long (MIPSpro warnings)

2004-03-03 14:07  bagder

	* lib/hostip.c: tv_sec is an int, so we explicitly typecast the
	  result of long - long to an int when we assign it.

2004-03-03 14:03  bagder

	* ares/ares__read_line.c: attempted typecase to silence the MIPSpro
	  warning:

	  cc-1506 cc: REMARK File = ../../curl/ares/ares__read_line.c, Line
	  = 46 There is an implicit conversion from "unsigned long" to
	  "int"; rounding, sign extension, or loss of accuracy may result.

	  if (!fgets(*buf + offset, *bufsize - offset, fp))

2004-03-03 13:37  bagder

	* include/curl/curl.h: #ifdef #define #undef circus to prevent
	  compiler warnings on #if operations with undefined variables.

2004-03-03 11:09  bagder

	* tests/libtest/: lib503.c, lib504.c, lib507.c, lib509.c: removed
	  include stuff now handled by test.h

2004-03-03 11:09  bagder

	* tests/libtest/test.h: We let this file include more generic
	  headers that many libtests need anyway to reduce the amount of
	  #include stuff in each single libNNN.c file.	unistd.h was added
	  to prevent select() warnings on FreeBSD

2004-03-03 10:27  bagder

	* src/setup.h, lib/setup.h: Tom Bates' adjustment to build on his
	  nsr-tandem-nsk.

2004-03-03 10:25  bagder

	* lib/: file.c, urldata.h: rename struct FILE to FILEPROTO, to
	  prevent it from causing trouble with the plain old FILE typedef.

2004-03-03 10:16  bagder

	* configure.ac: Dan Fandrich fixed some GSS detection flaws

2004-03-02 15:00  bagder

	* lib/url.c: corrected the reuse_fresh condition

2004-03-02 11:22  bagder

	* docs/HISTORY: large file in jan 2004

2004-03-02 11:08  bagder

	* docs/TODO: various updates

2004-03-02 11:07  bagder

	* docs/KNOWN_BUGS: two items fixed, one so old I don't think its
	  valid anymore

2004-03-02 10:50  bagder

	* testcurl.sh: display src/config.h as well after configure as run

2004-03-02 10:31  bagder

	* lib/: file.c, ftp.c, http.c, progress.c, setup.h, transfer.c,
	  url.c: Yet another curl_off_t printf format attempt, we now
	  exclude the %-letter from FORMAT_OFF_T to allow additional
	  options to get specified, like with '"%5" FORMAT_OFF_T'.

2004-03-02 10:13  bagder

	* src/setup.h: Define CURL_NO_OLDIES to prevent us from getting
	  obsolete stuff defined.

2004-03-02 10:11  bagder

	* src/main.c: CURLOPT_MUTE is obsolete since a long while, we don't
	  need to set it!

2004-03-02 09:28  bagder

	* docs/Makefile.am: clean the html and pdf files

2004-03-02 08:25  bagder

	* lib/: file.c, ftp.c, http.c, progress.c, transfer.c, url.c: use
	  FORMAT_OFF_T instead of CURL_FORMAT_OFF_T to reduce the
	  complexity of having to redef that name

2004-03-02 08:25  bagder

	* lib/setup.h: - we switch to simply use FORMAT_OFF_T internally -
	  Also, we must not assume that SIZEOF_CURL_OFF_T is defined, as
	  this file gets included from the ares dir at times and then it
	  isn't defined.

2004-03-01 17:32  bagder

	* RELEASE-NOTES: the CURLOPT_FRESH_CONNECT fix

2004-03-01 17:30  bagder

	* CHANGES: a fair day's work!

2004-03-01 17:28  bagder

	* lib/: file.c, ftp.c, http.c, progress.c, url.c: Use
	  CURL_FORMAT_OFF_T for printf()inf curl_off_t variables.

2004-03-01 17:27  bagder

	* lib/transfer.c: Now uses CURL_FORMAT_OFF_T instead of %Od Fixed
	  the check for bad resumes. Made test case 99 work and proved a
	  bug in test case ... eh, was it 32?

2004-03-01 17:25  bagder

	* tests/FILEFORMAT: large_file is a new feature we can require for
	  a specific test

2004-03-01 17:24  bagder

	* tests/runtests.pl: support 'large_file' as a feature to require
	  for specific tests (such as test 99)

2004-03-01 17:24  bagder

	* src/main.c: check for CURL_VERSION_LARGEFILE in the feature
	  bitmask

2004-03-01 17:24  bagder

	* lib/version.c: set CURL_VERSION_LARGEFILE if we support large
	  files

2004-03-01 17:23  bagder

	* lib/setup.h: define ENABLE_64BIT if we have enabled 64bit large
	  files define our internal CURL_FORMAT_OFF_T define, we don't use
	  the global one!

2004-03-01 17:22  bagder

	* lib/mprintf.c: fixed the test code to work

2004-03-01 17:20  bagder

	* include/curl/curl.h: * Added CURL_VERSION_LARGEFILE

	  * If CURL_NO_OLDIES is defined, we hide all obsolete
	  functions/options.

	  * CURL_FORMAT_OFF_T is defined for portable printf()ing of
	  curl_off_t types (although not with curl_mprintf()!)

2004-03-01 17:18  bagder

	* tests/data/: Makefile.am, test99: added test 99, very basic
	  initial large file test

2004-03-01 16:50  bagder

	* docs/libcurl/curl_easy_setopt.3: global dns cache is not nice, we
	  consider it obsolete starting now

2004-03-01 14:14  bagder

	* testcurl.sh: Ignore the dreaded aclocal warnings on underquoted
	  definitions that the recent autoconf annoyingly introduced.

2004-03-01 14:10  bagder

	* acinclude.m4: Perhaps -Wundef is better on gcc versions after
	  2.95, since the autobuild on FreeBSD gives us lots of warnings in
	  system headers and I suspect this option is what causes them!

2004-03-01 14:02  bagder

	* acinclude.m4: When setting aggressive pedantic compiler options,
	  display what options that were set. For easier debugging/changing
	  of this.

2004-03-01 13:54  bagder

	* lib/base64.c: removed an unnecessary shift and splut up som weird
	  two-statements-per-line code

2004-03-01 13:45  bagder

	* src/main.c: Use the z-option to printf %d for size_t printf. z is
	  supported by the libcurl *printf and by Linux printf(). This
	  should make the code work nicely even for 64bit size_ts.

2004-03-01 13:44  bagder

	* lib/mprintf.c: Support 'z' for size_t-sized integer printing, as
	  in %zd or %zx.

2004-03-01 10:43  bagder

	* lib/url.c: Only consider the fresh-connection option on the first
	  connection made, not on followed redirections etc. This should
	  fix the bug #905365, which caused NTLM to fail with the option
	  set.

2004-03-01 10:08  bagder

	* TODO-RELEASE, docs/TODO: Moved two 7.11.2 issues over to the more
	  general TODO docs.

2004-03-01 09:54  bagder

	* docs/FAQ: minor spellfix

2004-03-01 09:50  bagder

	* docs/THANKS: intend the top-level blurb to make it easier to
	  discard it from the web site output

2004-03-01 09:20  bagder

	* docs/THANKS: Tor and David

2004-03-01 09:02  bagder

	* docs/libcurl/curl_share_init.3: mention how to make a curl handle
	  use the share

2004-03-01 08:59  bagder

	* lib/ftp.c: Only attempt to send the FTP QUIT command if we
	  actually have a FTP struct.

2004-03-01 08:19  bagder

	* lib/url.c: in Curl_disonnect(): call the protocol-specific
	  disconnect function before we unlink the "current" connection
	  struct from the connection cache.

2004-03-01 08:16  bagder

	* tests/ftpserver.pl: Report the correct size when 'verifiedserver'
	  is requested.

2004-02-29 19:39  bagder

	* ares/Makefile.in: Dirk Manske fixed the attempt to install the
	  removed errmem manpage

2004-02-27 16:48  bagder

	* docs/libcurl/Makefile.am: using roffit 0.6 we can get <a href>
	  links with the --mandir option

2004-02-27 16:34  bagder

	* docs/libcurl/: curl_easy_cleanup.3, curl_easy_duphandle.3,
	  curl_easy_getinfo.3, curl_easy_init.3, curl_easy_perform.3,
	  curl_easy_setopt.3, curl_escape.3, curl_formadd.3,

	  curl_global_cleanup.3, curl_global_init.3, curl_slist_append.3,
	  curl_slist_free_all.3, curl_unescape.3, curl_version_info.3:
	  formatting update to produce better links with the new roffit
	  version

2004-02-27 15:07  bagder

	* docs/libcurl/curl_easy_setopt.3: elaborate on the URL option

2004-02-27 14:21  bagder

	* ares/: ares_private.h, ares_process.c: minor size_t fix to kill a
	  warning

2004-02-27 14:21  bagder

	* lib/formdata.c: fixed some more size_t/int/long warnings and
	  removed a few CMC comments

2004-02-27 13:41  bagder

	* include/curl/curl.h: Mark obsolete options with OSBOLETE in a
	  comment on the same line, to make it easier to exclude them with
	  grep, when grepping for options.

2004-02-27 13:27  bagder

	* CHANGES: ispell by Tor Arntsen

2004-02-27 12:29  bagder

	* ares/acinclude.m4: updated the debug option function from curl's
	  acinclude.m4

2004-02-27 10:02  bagder

	* RELEASE-NOTES: remove the number of obsolete options

2004-02-27 10:02  bagder

	* docs/libcurl/curl_easy_setopt.3: Added a few options that were
	  still not documented. Now I believe all options mentioned in the
	  current curl/curl.h header file (that aren't marked as obsolete)
	  are present.

2004-02-27 09:08  bagder

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES: updated with recent events

2004-02-27 08:15  bagder

	* TODO-RELEASE: issue 21 is now history

2004-02-27 08:08  bagder

	* lib/ftp.c, lib/urldata.h, tests/data/test100, tests/data/test101,
	  tests/data/test102, tests/data/test103, tests/data/test104,

	  tests/data/test145, tests/data/test146, tests/data/test147,
	  tests/data/test148, tests/data/test149, tests/data/test505: Joe
	  Halpin made the FTP code send 'QUIT' on the control connection
	  before it disconnects the TCP connection, like a good ftp client
	  should!

2004-02-26 23:56  bagder

	* tests/getpart.pm: we need to hide this warning since it otherwise
	  appears on all verifiedserver requests to the ftp server!

2004-02-26 23:40  bagder

	* tests/data/test190: Kill the server when this test is done, as
	  other FTP-tests sometimes have problems otherwise.

2004-02-26 23:19  bagder

	* ares/ares_init.c: fixed a "comparison between signed and
	  unsigned" warning

2004-02-26 17:23  bagder

	* CVS-INFO, Makefile.dist, include/curl/multi.h, lib/Makefile.vc6,
	  lib/config-win32.h, src/Makefile.vc6, src/main.c: David Byron's
	  fixes to make the latest curl build fine under MSVC 6.

2004-02-26 17:13  bagder

	* buildconf.bat: this works like buildconf + configure does on
	  unixes

2004-02-26 15:53  bagder

	* tests/memanalyze.pl: adjusted to work with the modified fopen()
	  line and the new calloc line

2004-02-26 15:52  bagder

	* lib/: memdebug.c, memdebug.h: Gisle Vanem's added support
	  calloc()-debugging and outputting mode for fopen() as well.

2004-02-26 15:52  bagder

	* lib/cookie.c: use calloc instead of malloc and we won't have to
	  memset() the struct

2004-02-26 14:59  bagder

	* testcurl.sh: When this is verified to be a CVS tree, we remove
	  the two generated source files from the source dir to make
	  certain they're generated in the build process.

2004-02-26 14:40  bagder

	* lib/: cookie.c, formdata.c, formdata.h, ftp.c, http.c, sendf.c,
	  urldata.h: Clear up int/long/size_t/ssize_t usage a bit

2004-02-26 13:47  bagder

	* ares/ares_init.c: minor fixes to avoid MIPSPro pedantic warnings

2004-02-26 13:45  bagder

	* ares/ares__read_line.c: don't mix int and size_t, it generates
	  warnings!

2004-02-26 13:40  bagder

	* acinclude.m4: Make icc ignore "invalid format string conversion"
	  warnings as well. They appear because of our home-grown option
	  '%Od' for the curl_off_t output.

2004-02-26 13:32  bagder

	* lib/mprintf.c: use %ld when printf()ing long variables (and
	  removed use of 'register')

2004-02-26 12:46  bagder

	* tests/ftpserver.pl: added the ever-present source header

2004-02-26 12:39  bagder

	* lib/share.c: Don't call the lock/unlock functions if they are
	  NULL. They can still be NULL without violating protocol.

2004-02-26 12:37  bagder

	* acinclude.m4: Use __INTEL_COMPILER instead of __ICC to the cpp to
	  detect the Intel icc compiler!

2004-02-26 10:19  bagder

	* tests/: ftpserver.pl, runtests.pl: runtests.pl now provides the
	  srcdir to the ftpserver so that it can pass that to loadtest
	  properly.

2004-02-26 10:19  bagder

	* tests/getpart.pm: modified loadtest() to produce better error
	  message when it fails to load a test file

2004-02-26 08:58  bagder

	* testcurl.sh: The build logs were created in the "wrong" dir and
	  thus never removed after use, this is an attempt to fix this.

2004-02-25 16:44  bagder

	* CHANGES: today's work

2004-02-25 16:43  bagder

	* tests/libtest/lib506.c: typecast to int when printfing CURLcode

2004-02-25 16:41  bagder

	* src/writeout.c: use %ld when printfing longs

2004-02-25 16:34  bagder

	* lib/mprintf.c: disable the use of long double, we don't use it

2004-02-25 15:32  bagder

	* buildconf: if ares is present, run aclocal in that dir before
	  autoconf is run

2004-02-25 15:32  bagder

	* ares/: CHANGES, FILES, acinclude.m4, aclocal.m4, configure.ac:
	  added the better debug option logic from curl by adding
	  acinclude.m4 to the configure stuff

2004-02-25 15:15  bagder

	* lib/mprintf.c: Based on a patch by Greg Hewgill I modified how
	  long long is used, as we can use a 64bit type with MSVC that is a
	  long long equivalent.

2004-02-25 15:14  bagder

	* acinclude.m4: set debug options when using the icc compiler

2004-02-25 13:34  bagder

	* docs/libcurl/curl_share_setopt.3: better formatting of the share
	  options

2004-02-25 13:32  bagder

	* docs/libcurl/curl_easy_setopt.3: mark the function name

2004-02-25 13:20  bagder

	* docs/libcurl/curl_easy_setopt.3: added CURLOPT_SHARE

2004-02-25 11:19  bagder

	* acinclude.m4, configure.ac: Moved most of the
	  set-debug-options-depending-on-compiler logic to the new
	  CURL_CC_DEBUG_OPTS function in acinclude.m4

2004-02-25 10:03  bagder

	* testcurl.sh: Output $CC and $CFLAGS as well. A Tor Arntsen patch.

2004-02-25 08:22  bagder

	* ares/ares.h: Don't check for HAVE_ defines in this header file,
	  it is meant to be public and we can't depend on configure-defines
	  in it. This logic is borrowed from the public curl headers.

2004-02-25 08:17  bagder

	* ares/CHANGES: fix

2004-02-25 07:37  bagder

	* ares/ares_init.c: Dan Fandrich fixed a minor flaw in Dominick's
	  fix!

2004-02-23 17:20  bagder

	* ares/configure.ac: check for a few basic header files

2004-02-23 17:20  bagder

	* ares/ares.h: include sys/select.h

2004-02-23 17:09  bagder

	* lib/krb4.c: fixed some warnings in the (both new and old) base64
	  usage

2004-02-23 17:04  bagder

	* TODO-RELEASE: features no one seem to care much about are now
	  moved over to the 7.11.2 release

2004-02-23 15:24  bagder

	* lib/strtoofft.h: make newer MSCV7 compilers use _strtoi64() as a
	  strtoll() replacement

2004-02-23 14:48  bagder

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES: limit rate and windows timeouts

2004-02-23 14:35  bagder

	* ares/: CHANGES, Makefile.in: ares_free_errmem is gone

2004-02-23 14:33  bagder

	* ares/: ares_free_errmem.3, ares_free_errmem.c: unused and now
	  removed

2004-02-23 13:01  bagder

	* lib/Makefile.b32: Removed getpass from here. The fact this still
	  was present here indicates that this file is out of date!

2004-02-23 12:59  bagder

	* lib/config-win32.h: curl_off_t is 8 bytes big on windows

2004-02-23 12:44  bagder

	* lib/base64.h: switch the arguments according to the c source

2004-02-23 12:39  bagder

	* lib/base64.c: oops, the decode() function got its arguments
	  reversed in my cleanup operation!

2004-02-23 10:01  bagder

	* docs/libcurl/: curl_formadd.3, curl_formfree.3: correct the input
	  data structs

2004-02-23 09:38  bagder

	* lib/hostip.c: use size_t to keep strlen() results

2004-02-23 09:35  bagder

	* lib/hostip.c: simplied how create_hostcache_id() is used, and
	  also its function somewhat cleared up some ssize_t/size_t mixups

2004-02-23 09:24  bagder

	* lib/http_ntlm.c: adjusted to the modified base64 protos

2004-02-23 09:22  bagder

	* lib/: base64.c, base64.h, http.c: More size_t cleanups in the
	  base64 functions.

2004-02-23 09:07  bagder

	* lib/: base64.c, base64.h, http_ntlm.c: The base64 encode function
	  now takes a size_t for size, not an int as previously.

2004-02-23 09:04  bagder

	* ares/ares_search.c: more int vs long/size_t fixes after icc
	  compiler warnings

2004-02-23 09:00  bagder

	* ares/ares_init.c: more int/long fixes after icc "remarks"

2004-02-23 08:57  bagder

	* ares/ares_init.c: next_id is an unsigned short, typecast the
	  assign to prevent picky compilers to warn

2004-02-23 08:55  bagder

	* ares/ares_gethostbyaddr.c: typecase the bitfiddling results since
	  we get a long and we store an int, they may not be of the size
	  size

2004-02-23 08:52  bagder

	* ares/: adig.c, ares.h, ares_expand_name.c, ares_parse_a_reply.c,
	  ares_parse_ptr_reply.c, ares_process.c: make ares_expand_name()
	  take a long * instead of an int *, since we do pointer arithmetic
	  (ptr1 - ptr2) and to do that properly on 64bit we need long

2004-02-23 08:46  bagder

	* ares/ares__read_line.c: strlen() returns a size_t, which might be
	  larger than int on some platforms

2004-02-23 08:32  bagder

	* testcurl.sh: argh, use single-quotes instead of double ones to
	  make $Revision appear

2004-02-23 08:17  bagder

	* testcurl.sh: use the proper source header, and set the version
	  string to this file's revision number

2004-02-23 08:08  bagder

	* testcurl.sh: cd back to the root path before removing the build
	  dir, since some systems refuse to remove the dir otherwise!

2004-02-22 23:42  bagder

	* ares/: CHANGES, ares_init.c: Dominick Meglio's fix for supporting
	  multiple names in the Nameserver key on Windows.

2004-02-22 23:36  bagder

	* ares/configure.ac: this code uses no long long, so we can have
	  warnings about them

2004-02-22 23:31  bagder

	* lib/: url.c, urldata.h: the missing part of Gisle Vanem's
	  connect-timeout fix for win32

2004-02-21 17:56  bagder

	* configure.ac: -Wno-format-nonliteral does not exist in my gcc
	  2.96, only use that with newer versions

2004-02-21 17:18  bagder

	* docs/curl.1: mention in --limit-rate that --speed-limit might
	  ruin the limiting slightly.

2004-02-21 16:08  bagder

	* src/main.c: David Byron's fix to allow the speed-limit logic work
	  even if you set limit-rate. It does work on the expense of the
	  rate limiter.

2004-02-21 16:05  bagder

	* lib/mprintf.c: added some extra typecasts to prevent compiler
	  warnings when converting int to various types

2004-02-21 15:57  bagder

	* lib/krb4.c: inlcude krb4.h to get the proto for Curl_krb_kauth()
	  to satisfy picky compilers

2004-02-20 17:41  bagder

	* lib/: config-win32.h, hostip.c, setup.h: Gisle Vanem brings name
	  resolving timeout possibilities to windows people.  This works by
	  magicly starting up a new thread that can be killed when the
	  timeout is reached. testtesttest!

2004-02-20 17:29  bagder

	* CHANGES: that icc attempt in configure

2004-02-20 17:22  bagder

	* lib/memdebug.c: Some compilers warn on completely empty source
	  files, we provide a blank one to prevent that.

2004-02-20 17:18  bagder

	* lib/md5.c: Convert functions to ANSI-style declaration to prevent
	  compiler warnings

2004-02-20 16:39  bagder

	* src/Makefile.am: When the built-in manual is disabled, we
	  generate a function doing nothing just to avoid making a totally
	  empty file. Just to avoid compiler warnings.

2004-02-20 16:16  bagder

	* lib/mprintf.c: No longer support Z as a flag to print size_t, it
	  isn't used by libcurl and I doubt anyone else uses it.

	  Better preprocessor magic for the O flag (for curl_off_t
	  printing) to prevent compiler warnings.

2004-02-20 14:09  bagder

	* packages/Win32/cygwin/README: cool.haxx.se, no longer sourceforge

2004-02-20 11:11  bagder

	* configure.ac: Only use -Wstrict-prototypes with gcc 3.3 or later.
	  It is working with earlier versions, but when I use it with
	  3.0.3, I can't get it to ignore errors in "system headers" with
	  -isystem so we get excessive amounts of warnings on SSL headers
	  which is very annoying.

2004-02-20 09:51  bagder

	* tests/libtest/: lib503.c, lib504.c, lib507.c, lib509.c: include
	  sys/select.h to prevent picky compiler warnings when using
	  select() without proto

2004-02-20 09:47  bagder

	* lib/: transfer.c, urldata.h: we call the macro CURLMAX() isntead
	  of MAX(), just because it turned up it collides with another MAX
	  define on some platforms (like netbsd 1.6.1)

2004-02-20 08:22  bagder

	* lib/strtoofft.h: oops, missed a define when I changed from Curl_
	  to curlx_

2004-02-20 08:19  bagder

	* tests/server/: getpart.c, sws.c: fix protos to prevent warnings

2004-02-20 08:19  bagder

	* tests/server/: Makefile.am, getpart.h: added getpart.h for the
	  spitout() proto

2004-02-20 08:14  bagder

	* tests/runtests.pl: %HTTPPORT supported in subVariables

2004-02-20 08:05  bagder

	* tests/README: mention what ports the test suite uses

2004-02-20 07:59  bagder

	* tests/runtests.pl: When trying to see if there's a friendly http
	  server on "our" port, we only accept return code 7 to indicate
	  that there's no server present.

2004-02-19 22:34  bagder

	* configure.ac: -Wcast-align is a bit too annoying

2004-02-19 22:32  bagder

	* configure.ac: Anything that looks like gcc 5.0 or more is no
	  longer treated as gcc. I hope this will make us exclude icc 8.0
	  etc.

2004-02-19 22:21  bagder

	* tests/README: refer to FILEFORMAT

2004-02-19 20:25  bagder

	* configure.ac: When --enable-debug is used, for every -I provided
	  to $CPPFLAGS we add a corresponding -isystem, if using gcc, to
	  inhibit warnings on those headers.

2004-02-19 17:24  bagder

	* testcurl.sh: Tor Arntsen's tiny fix!

2004-02-19 16:58  bagder

	* configure.ac: if not yacc or bison is found, check if we *really*
	  need it, and if we do we bail out!

2004-02-19 16:39  bagder

	* tests/libtest/lib509.c: fixed the no-ssl version to return int as
	  well

2004-02-19 14:03  bagder

	* tests/libtest/lib506.c: provide protos to the functions to
	  prevent warnings

2004-02-19 14:00  bagder

	* tests/libtest/lib500.c: typecast the type to an int on return

2004-02-19 14:00  bagder

	* tests/libtest/lib500.c: return int from test()

2004-02-19 13:59  bagder

	* tests/libtest/test.h: provide a test() proto

2004-02-19 13:56  bagder

	* testcurl.sh: use a die and a log function to die and log texts
	  better detect test suite failures remove the buildlog at exit
	  make a random buildlog file name, now in the same dir where the
	  build dir is created checks if the ares build succeeded

2004-02-19 13:10  bagder

	* testcurl.sh: remove the build.log too at exit, and also use the
	  proper $pwd prefix to find the files/dirs to remove so that it
	  still works if we "die" after having done a 'cd'

2004-02-19 11:21  bagder

	* docs/libcurl/curl_easy_setopt.3: very minor phrase edit

2004-02-19 11:21  bagder

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES: fixes from the recent days

2004-02-19 10:33  bagder

	* ares/configure.ac: check for standard headers when --enable-debug
	  is used

2004-02-19 10:22  bagder

	* lib/netrc.c: Doug Porter's patch that changes the order of
	  preferences on how to find the default netrc file. We now read
	  and uses HOME _before_ we use getpwuid() to better allow users to
	  move around HOME to use different .netrc files without having to
	  rely on even blacker magic.

2004-02-19 10:01  bagder

	* configure.ac: If --enable-debug is used and gcc, we figure out
	  which version and then we use as aggressive warning options as
	  possible for the used compiler version.

2004-02-19 09:19  bagder

	* TODO-RELEASE: item 19 is considered fixed until we get to hear
	  differently item 25 is now dealt with using the curlx_ prefix,
	  mentioned in detail here:
	  http://curl.haxx.se/mail/lib-2004-02/0215.html

2004-02-19 09:13  bagder

	* src/: Makefile.am, main.c: Use the strtoofft.h header file from
	  the lib directory, as we are now officially using library-code
	  when building the app (at least for the platforms that don't have
	  a strtoll() on their own).

2004-02-19 09:12  bagder

	* lib/: strtoofft.c, strtoofft.h: Remade to use curlx_-prefix. This
	  means this function can be compiled and linked separately by the
	  application. This function is not provided by the libcurl API. It
	  can only be accessed by apps if they compile and use this
	  particular source code.

2004-02-18 17:16  bagder

	* buildconf: AIX and Tru64 have what Tor calls "horribly broken
	  'which' programs" so we now scan the PATH ourself to find the
	  path to (g)libtool

2004-02-18 16:28  bagder

	* lib/transfer.c: removed some "jhrg" from comments

2004-02-18 13:26  bagder

	* ares/configure.ac: I removed the socklen_t requirement from
	  memdebug.h, so we don't need to figure it out here anymore to
	  build debug builds.

2004-02-18 13:22  bagder

	* lib/: memdebug.c, memdebug.h: Made curl_accept() take a 'void *'
	  instead of 'socklen_t *' in the 3rd argument to also not force
	  the casual includer to know about the socklen_t type.

2004-02-18 13:18  bagder

	* lib/: memdebug.c, memdebug.h: Modified curl_accept() to take a
	  'void *' in the 2nd argument instead of sockaddr *. This has the
	  added benefit that source files that include memdebug.h doesn't
	  have to know about "sockaddr".

2004-02-18 11:05  bagder

	* lib/hostip.c: No longer uses the 'ret' variable in the plain
	  ipv4-version of my_getaddrinfo() (caused a warning by the IRIX
	  MIPSPro compiler). Also clarified the situation for the 3-arg
	  version of gethostbyname_r() with a huge comment.

2004-02-18 10:07  bagder

	* ares/configure.ac: The --enable-debug option really requires this
	  to be built as part of curl.	When using it, we now set the
	  include path to better find the devel curl headers, and we check
	  for the socklen_t type since the curl memdebug stuff needs it.

2004-02-18 09:35  bagder

	* lib/setup.h: simplified and better commented config.h include
	  logic

2004-02-18 08:56  bagder

	* lib/hostip.c: Make sure dns cache timeout -1 really means
	  forever, as it is documented to be. Simply skip the pruning.

2004-02-17 14:46  bagder

	* src/main.c: fix the help text for --manual if built without
	  manual

2004-02-17 08:57  bagder

	* tests/libtest/.cvsignore: ignore more

2004-02-17 08:41  bagder

	* ares/CHANGES: memdebug build, 'make' no longer builds the demo
	  tools

2004-02-17 08:40  bagder

	* ares/Makefile.in: 'make all' also builds the demos

2004-02-17 08:40  bagder

	* ares/: ares_destroy.c, ares_expand_name.c, ares_free_hostent.c:
	  include ares_private.h to make sure we get the memdebug stuff
	  included

2004-02-17 08:40  bagder

	* ares/ares_private.h: If CURLDEBUG is set we use the libcurl
	  internal memdebug system to track memory leaks etc.

2004-02-16 17:27  bagder

	* ares/Makefile.in: only build adig and ahost if 'make demos' is
	  used

2004-02-16 17:24  bagder

	* lib/memdebug.h: support closesocket() for closing sockets as
	  well, as then we can use this code fine on ares!

2004-02-16 17:23  bagder

	* lib/memdebug.c: Make realloc() support NULL as pointer. Made to
	  allow us to use these routines to memdebug the ares stuff as
	  well.

2004-02-16 16:27  bagder

	* TODO-RELEASE: item 24 fixed, edited a few issues

2004-02-16 16:24  bagder

	* lib/: hostip.c, url.c: Make the 'areschannel' get created in the
	  curl_easy_init() and re-use that same channel during the whole
	  curl handle's life until curl_easy_cleanup().

2004-02-16 14:36  bagder

	* RELEASE-NOTES: updates

2004-02-16 14:33  bagder

	* CHANGES: verbose-fix, socks5-fix, dnscache-fix,
	  configure-winmmlib-fix

2004-02-16 14:14  bagder

	* lib/url.c: Fix verbosconnect() when ipv6-enabled to not assume
	  that conn->serv_addr is a valid pointer, but instead always
	  depend on the passed-in dns pointer.	This happens to be NULL
	  when the connection is re-used...

2004-02-16 10:56  bagder

	* lib/md5.c: removed usage of a silly macro instead of the actual
	  functions memcpy and memset

2004-02-16 08:33  bagder

	* lib/url.c: Jeff Lawson pointed out that we need to check for a
	  '5' in the version field to properly work with SOCKS5 proxies. I
	  also included some ascii art describing the SOCKS5 response, as
	  RFC1928 describes. Jeff provided details in bug report #741841
	  and here: http://curl.haxx.se/mail/lib-2004-02/0181.html

2004-02-15 23:34  bagder

	* configure.ac: Andrs Garca added a check for lwinmm for
	  Mingw/sys

2004-02-15 17:57  bagder

	* lib/hostip.c: Mark the dns entry 'inuse' properly even when used
	  from the cache. This seems to correct some host cache screw-ups I
	  could reproduce.

2004-02-15 14:58  bagder

	* lib/content_encoding.c: another case which should use CURLcode
	  and not int

2004-02-15 14:55  bagder

	* lib/connect.c: Use the was_iface variable when binding a socket
	  locally, even if no SO_BINDTODEVICE is present, to prevent
	  compiler warnings about the variable

2004-02-15 14:51  bagder

	* RELEASE-NOTES: bind interface and large file fixes

2004-02-15 14:50  bagder

	* CHANGES: recent fixes

2004-02-15 14:48  bagder

	* lib/telnet.c: (void) functions we don't check the return code for

2004-02-15 14:48  bagder

	* lib/transfer.c: CURLcode/int cleanup to reduce IRIX warnings
	  Removed some dates/names in the comments.

2004-02-15 14:47  bagder

	* testcurl.sh: spell!

2004-02-15 13:30  bagder

	* ares/configure.ac: don't assume we can use gcc 2.96+ options

2004-02-13 13:42  bagder

	* lib/url.c: in the socks code, make sure we receive Curl_read
	  results in ints and Curl_write in CURLcode, to keep the picky
	  compilers happy

2004-02-13 13:28  bagder

	* ares/: adig.c, ahost.c: removed usage of unset variables (by a
	  function that does nothing!)

2004-02-13 13:18  bagder

	* tests/libtest/lib506.c: return an int

2004-02-13 13:17  bagder

	* tests/libtest/lib504.c: return an int, not a CURLcode

2004-02-13 13:16  bagder

	* lib/content_encoding.c: use CURLcode, not int, prevents picky
	  compilers to warn

2004-02-13 13:13  bagder

	* lib/file.c: the now and start variables were never really used

2004-02-13 10:50  bagder

	* lib/connect.c: Ben Greear's SO_BINDTODEVICE patch that binds to a
	  network interface "even more" when the previous approach. Known
	  to work on Linux, possibly on other platforms as well.

2004-02-13 08:15  bagder

	* testcurl.sh: Tor Arntsen made the ares build warnings etc get
	  included as well

2004-02-13 08:12  bagder

	* lib/transfer.c: Greg Hewgill found out 'contentlength' wasn't big
	  enough to hold a large file!

2004-02-13 08:05  bagder

	* tests/server/sws.c: make the path const

2004-02-13 08:03  bagder

	* lib/file.c: I made the same fix here, that Tor already did in the
	  ftp.c code. To make sure this doesn't get weird on 64bit archs.

2004-02-13 07:59  bagder

	* lib/ftp.c: Tor Arntsen's fix for the bad (64bit wise) typecast
	  when using gmtime()

2004-02-12 17:02  bagder

	* lib/hostip.c: Make hostcache_fixoffset() take a long for offset,
	  to fully work with 64bit archs, also no longer typecast pointers
	  to ints as that is a nono on 64bit systems.

2004-02-12 16:50  bagder

	* RELEASE-NOTES: up to date with recent fixes

2004-02-12 16:05  bagder

	* configure.ac: If no nroff tool is found, or if no command line
	  switch to nroff that converts a man page to text is found, we
	  disable the built-in manual stuff to still be able to build.

2004-02-12 15:46  bagder

	* src/: Makefile.am, config.h.in, main.c: support configure
	  --disable-manual

2004-02-12 15:45  bagder

	* configure.ac: added --enable/disable-manual

2004-02-12 15:43  bagder

	* tests/Makefile.am: no need to run make test in the data dir
	  anymore

2004-02-12 15:40  bagder

	* tests/: getpart.pm, httpserver.pl, runtests.pl, server/sws.c:
	  provide a source path to the servers to make them find the tests
	  when run outside the source dir, not needing any symlinks

2004-02-12 15:39  bagder

	* tests/data/Makefile.am: stop doing the weirdo symlinks

2004-02-12 10:53  bagder

	* lib/telnet.c: removed the subchar variable, it was only set and
	  never used

2004-02-12 10:51  bagder

	* lib/ldap.c: removed the ldaptext variable, it was only set and
	  never used

2004-02-12 10:50  bagder

	* lib/dict.c: removed the nth variable, it was only set and never
	  used anyway

2004-02-12 10:48  bagder

	* lib/url.c: No longer receive the return code in
	  ConnectionKillOne() that wasn't dealt with anyway and thus caused
	  picky compiler to warn.

2004-02-11 22:14  bagder

	* configure.ac: Andrs Garca's additional fix to make the OpenSSL
	  stuff work for msys/mingw

2004-02-11 22:11  bagder

	* lib/url.c: #if-check for SIGALRM before assuming it is present

2004-02-11 14:08  bagder

	* buildconf: use libtoolize --force to overwrite existing (older)
	  files

2004-02-11 13:59  bagder

	* ares/CHANGES: install ares_version.h as well

2004-02-11 13:58  bagder

	* ares/Makefile.in: Dirk Manske's fix to install ares_version.h as
	  well

2004-02-09 17:16  bagder

	* CHANGES: mondays are busy days catching up with the patches from
	  the weekend! ;-)

2004-02-09 14:51  bagder

	* docs/libcurl/curl_easy_setopt.3: Dominick Meglio's update

2004-02-09 14:41  bagder

	* TODO-RELEASE: recent updates

2004-02-09 13:46  bagder

	  tests/data/test93, tests/data/test95, tests/data/test97,
	  tests/data/test98: Modified the default HTTP Accept: header to
	  only be Accept: */*

2004-02-09 12:41  bagder

	* tests/data/test96: Removed, this was only used to work out what
	  went wrong with test 91, and we seem to have nailed that one now!

2004-02-09 12:40  bagder

	* lib/connect.c: Oops. I broke the flow with the previous commit.

2004-02-09 11:24  bagder

	* packages/Linux/RPM/curl-ssl.spec.in: P R Schaffner updated this
	  to work for 7.11.0

2004-02-09 10:07  bagder

	* docs/libcurl/: curl_share_cleanup.3, curl_share_init.3,
	  curl_share_setopt.3, libcurl-errors.3: Dominick Meglio's added
	  share interface documentation

2004-02-09 09:55  bagder

	* testcurl.sh: removed the state file renaming I accidentally left
	  there

2004-02-09 09:34  bagder

	* lib/connect.c: some annoying compilers warn about "(void)foo;"
	  lines so we avoid them

2004-02-09 09:31  bagder

	* src/main.c: Make param2text() take an int argument, as that is
	  what's being passed in.  This is made to prevent compiler
	  warnings.

2004-02-09 09:29  bagder

	* src/writeout.c: use VAR_NONE instead of 0 in the table to prevent
	  compiler warning

2004-02-09 09:28  bagder

	* tests/libtest/lib502.c: return 'res' to better discover test
	  failures and to stop compiler warnings about it never being used

2004-02-09 09:25  bagder

	* tests/libtest/lib506.c: Uninitialized variable set.

2004-02-09 08:52  bagder

	* lib/ftp.c: Tor Arntsen's patch for working around a notorious bug
	  in the AIX5 getaddrinfo() implementation.

2004-02-09 08:12  bagder

	* docs/examples/curlgtk.c: Ken Rastatter's fixes to improve
	  portability of this example:

	  These minor changes remove portability issues with the this
	  example and allow it to run on Win32. Specifically:

	  * The use of pthread_create() has been replaced by
	  g_thread_create(). This removes the dependency on the pthreads
	  library. Since this is an example using GTK+, g_thread_create()
	  is available as it is a part of glibc.

	  * The CURLOPT_FILE option is now referred to by its "newer name"
	  CURLOPT_WRITEDATA.

	  * The use of CURLOPT_WRITEFUNCTION has been added.  As described
	  in the docs, this avoids the crashes when using a DLL under
	  Win32.

	  * The output file has been renamed from "/tmp/test.curl" to
	  "test.curl". It's unlikely that there is a /tmp when in Win32 and
	  other examples in libcurl write their output files to the working
	  directory.

2004-02-06 15:27  bagder

	* CHANGES: mingw configure fix, host: fix, compiler warnings in
	  ldap.c

2004-02-06 15:23  bagder

	* RELEASE-NOTES: updated with recent fixes

2004-02-06 15:17  bagder

	* TODO-RELEASE: The Curl_strtoll() issue

2004-02-06 14:42  bagder

	* TODO-RELEASE: updated

2004-02-06 13:13  bagder

	* configure.ac: Rewrote the gethostbyname() check after Andrs
	  Garca's provided patch for finding it using mingw on windows.  I
	  also made the script skip the search for gethostbyname_r and
	  gethostbyaddr_r when ipv6 is enabled.

2004-02-06 11:17  bagder

	* docs/curl.1: Added documentation of a few command line options
	  that were still undocumented here.

2004-02-06 09:11  bagder

	* lib/http.c: A custom Host: header is only considered if the
	  request is not made by following a location. After discussions
	  with Tim Baker.

2004-02-06 08:59  bagder

	* lib/transfer.c: The MIPSPro compiler complains on constructs such
	  as "(void)foo;" so we avoid it where possible.

2004-02-06 08:28  bagder

	* lib/ldap.c: Make sure DynaGetFunction() returns a function
	  pointer, not a data pointer.	The standards don't actually allow
	  typecasts between data and functions so some picky compilers warn
	  about this.

2004-02-06 08:15  bagder

	* testcurl.sh: Remove the attempt to detect if we already tested
	  the same source setup.  We really don't care, and so many other
	  things could've changed to make the new test interesting anyway.

2004-02-05 22:52  bagder

	* CHANGES: numerous things went in today

2004-02-05 22:51  bagder

	* tests/FILEFORMAT: added the missing stdin section

2004-02-05 22:40  bagder

	* configure.ac: An attempt to only set both libz-related defines at
	  the same time. We need both the lib and the header present for
	  both defines to be set. If only one of the files is found, we
	  issue a warning and set no define.

2004-02-05 22:03  bagder

	* src/Makefile.m32, lib/Makefile.m32: Andrs Garca's updates

2004-02-05 16:50  bagder

	* lib/http.c: if an empty 'transfer-encoding:' header is provided,
	  we switch off the chunky coding of uploads

2004-02-05 16:21  bagder

	* tests/data/: Makefile.am, test98: Made a test that sends data on
	  stdin to PUT, with a given length and chunked transfer-encoding
	  disabled. Fixed to work after Len Krause's bug report.

2004-02-05 14:25  bagder

	* lib/telnet.c: Gisle Vanem fixed a windows compiler warning

2004-02-05 13:34  bagder

	* tests/libtest/: first.c, lib501.c, lib502.c, lib503.c, lib504.c,
	  lib505.c, lib506.c, lib507.c, lib508.c, lib509.c, lib510.c:
	  changed the test() function to return type int

2004-02-05 13:19  bagder

	* ares/nameser.h: include process.h to get the _getpid() proto

2004-02-05 11:38  bagder

	* configure.ac: when using --enable-debug and gcc, provide the
	  -Wno-format-nonliteral option to prevent the warning in
	  mprintf.c:

	  (currently line 930) "format not a string literal, argument types
	  not checked"

2004-02-05 10:38  bagder

	* lib/url.c: options we get as longs need to be typecasted when
	  assigned to prevent picky compiler warnings

2004-02-05 10:38  bagder

	* lib/telnet.c: fix return type to silence compiler warnings

2004-02-05 10:37  bagder

	* lib/version.c: prevent warning from that picky MIPSpro compiler

2004-02-05 10:37  bagder

	* lib/multi.c: compiler warning fix, compare struct pointers of the
	  same type

2004-02-05 10:26  bagder

	* lib/ftp.c: use the timeout options when waiting for the server to
	  connect when using PORT Provide better error messages to allow
	  debugging if one if the ipv6-related name functions fail in the
	  ftp_use_port() function. This might help us diagnose the problems
	  on AIX. Also make sure getaddrinfo() uses NULL and not "0" for
	  the service argument.

2004-02-05 09:34  bagder

	* lib/hostip.c: hide the pack_hostent proto if ipv6 is enabled, as
	  figured out by Tor Arntsen

2004-02-05 09:27  bagder

	* src/config.h.in: Fix the socklen_t type too. Needed only when
	  built with memory debugging as then we include the memdebug.h
	  header from the lib dir, and it then requires this type... (fails
	  on IRIX 6.5 without this)

2004-02-04 11:24  bagder

	* ares/adig.c: fixed "comparison between signed and unsigned"
	  complaints

2004-02-04 11:23  bagder

	* ares/ares_process.c: don't use 'sin' as variable name as the
	  picky compiler warnings complain about it shadowing the function
	  sin()

2004-02-04 10:16  bagder

	* ares/CHANGES: fixing

2004-02-04 09:04  bagder

	* ares/nameser.h: prevent a compiler warning about a macro
	  definition

2004-02-04 09:00  bagder

	* ares/: nameser.h, windows_port.c: prevent the windows version to
	  use global symbol names added prototypes for the strcasecmp()
	  functions

2004-02-04 08:54  bagder

	* ares/configure.ac: we use the more aggressive compiler warnings

2004-02-04 08:52  bagder

	* ares/ares_private.h: made more pointers unsigned, as they were
	  mostly used passed in to functions that assume them to be
	  unsigned. Stops compiler warnings.

2004-02-04 08:51  bagder

	* ares/: ares_parse_a_reply.c, ares_parse_ptr_reply.c: typecast
	  comparision between signed and unsigned

2004-02-04 08:50  bagder

	* ares/ares_init.c: try_config() takes a second parameter as const,
	  to prevent picky compiler warnings

2004-02-04 08:50  bagder

	* ares/ares_free_string.3: takes a void *, not a char * anymore

2004-02-04 08:49  bagder

	* ares/: ares.h, ares_free_string.c: ares_free_string() now takes a
	  void * instead

2004-02-04 08:48  bagder

	* ares/ares_strerror.c: don't compare signed and unsigned

2004-02-04 08:48  bagder

	* ares/Makefile.in: added a tags target

2004-02-04 08:48  bagder

	* ares/FILES: new configure file

2004-02-04 08:47  bagder

	* ares/: configure.ac, configure.in: use configure.ac instead of
	  configure.in support --enable-debug to switch on picky compiler
	  options

2004-02-04 08:40  bagder

	* ares/ares_free_errmem.c: stop a compiler warning

2004-02-03 16:59  bagder

	* docs/MANUAL: no one uses libcurl before 7.7 anyway...

2004-02-03 15:06  bagder

	* ares/CHANGES: libcares.a is here

2004-02-03 14:58  bagder

	* configure.ac: link with libcares instead of libares

2004-02-03 14:58  bagder

	* ares/Makefile.in: We now produce 'libcares.a' instead, to make it
	  possible to have both c-ares and the original ares installed in
	  the same lib dir.

2004-02-03 11:07  bagder

	* CHANGES: the configure and memdebug fixes of yday

2004-02-03 10:52  bagder

	* lib/ftp.c: the unused quit-function didn't pass a correct
	  variable type to the response reading function

2004-02-03 10:40  bagder

	* ares/README.cares: add link to the new cares web site

2004-02-03 10:16  bagder

	* ares/: ares_strerror.3, ares_version.3: added notes about
	  incompatible functions

2004-02-03 09:58  bagder

	* ares/ares_strerror.3: adjusted to the new single-parameter
	  version of this function

2004-02-03 09:47  bagder

	* ares/ares_expand_name.3: removed odd newline

2004-02-03 07:39  bagder

	* lib/version.c: added the missing ares numerical version
	  initialiser

2004-02-03 07:38  bagder

	* ares/CHANGES: modified *strerror()

2004-02-02 23:39  bagder

	* src/Makefile.am: Use the nroff option figured out by the
	  configure script. An attempt to make this better on more systems.

2004-02-02 23:39  bagder

	* configure.ac: try to figure out if -man or -mandoc works to get
	  text with the NROFF utility

2004-02-02 22:34  bagder

	* lib/memdebug.h: undef accept before defining it, since AIX 5.2
	  has it as a define!

2004-02-02 17:29  bagder

	* CHANGES: more test91 tweaks and some c-ares stuff

2004-02-02 17:24  bagder

	* lib/version.c: now provides c-ares version info in both version
	  calls

2004-02-02 17:24  bagder

	* include/curl/curl.h: Introducing the SECOND version of the
	  version_info struct. This should be backwards compatible with
	  older libcurls just fine.

2004-02-02 17:15  bagder

	* ares/: adig.c, ahost.c: use the new single-argument
	  ares_strerror()

2004-02-02 17:00  bagder

	* lib/hostip.c: adjusted to the modified ares_strerror() function

	  NOTE that this breaks ares-compatibility, we have now officially
	  taken the turn into the c-ares path. We will now officially
	  depend on c-ares for asynch name resolves.

2004-02-02 16:59  bagder

	* ares/: adig.c, ahost.c, ares__close_sockets.c,
	  ares__get_hostent.c, ares__read_line.c, ares_destroy.c,
	  ares_expand_name.c, ares_fds.c, ares_free_errmem.c,
	  ares_free_hostent.c, ares_free_string.c, ares_gethostbyaddr.c,
	  ares_gethostbyname.c, ares_init.c, ares_mkquery.c,
	  ares_parse_a_reply.c, ares_parse_ptr_reply.c, ares_process.c,
	  ares_query.c, ares_search.c, ares_send.c, ares_timeout.c: remove
	  rcsid stuff from c files, it serves no useful purpose

2004-02-02 16:59  bagder

	* ares/: ares.h, ares_strerror.c: removed the silly second argument
	  to ares_strerror()

	  This breaks the API and ABI with the existing ares library. We
	  hereby require the upcoming c-ares 1.0 for asynch name resolves!

2004-02-02 16:53  bagder

	* lib/hostip.c: Dirk Manske fixed the ares usage even more. We
	  could get a timeout from ares as well, and when failing and not
	  getting a timeout we now include the error message ares can
	  provide us with.

2004-02-02 16:34  bagder

	* docs/INSTALL: mention mpe/ix

2004-02-02 15:49  bagder

	* lib/: http.c, if2ip.c, transfer.c, urldata.h: set the 'retry' bit
	  to TRUE when the connection is about to be retried, this allows
	  the HTTP code to *not* return a failure just because no data has
	  been received from the server

2004-02-02 15:49  bagder

	* lib/sendf.c: clear the sockerror if no error was returned

2004-02-02 13:46  bagder

	* CHANGES: ares resolve timeout and ca bundle include fixes

2004-02-02 12:59  bagder

	* lib/setup.h: we include errno.h to truly know if we have
	  ECONNRESET or not

2004-02-02 11:15  bagder

	* lib/hostip.c: Timeout slow ares name lookups. This is based on
	  the patch brought by Dirk Manske, but modified by me.

2004-02-02 11:13  bagder

	* lib/url.c: when including ca-bundle.h, don't look in the current
	  dir first, simply use the search path since we want the
	  build-version rather than the one in the source dir

2004-02-02 08:24  bagder

	* src/getpass.c: fixed the win32 function to use the correct proto,
	  as pointed out by Gisle Vanem

2004-02-02 08:21  bagder

	* CHANGES: test case 97

2004-02-02 08:13  bagder

	* tests/data/: Makefile.am, test97: added test 97, a simple test
	  with -d post and a replacede content-type header using -H

2004-01-30 13:43  bagder

	* CHANGES: attempt to fix the notorious test 91 failures

2004-01-30 13:41  bagder

	* lib/transfer.c: make sure the connection is closed when it was
	  detected reset!

2004-01-23 13:50  bagder

	* src/main.c: Use Curl_strtoll() if needed. This is not a library

	  internal function. Thus the captical C in the beginning.

2004-01-23 13:49  bagder

	* src/Makefile.am: use the Curl_strtoll() source code from the lib
	  code

2004-01-23 09:36  bagder

	  could easily get messed up. Vincent Bronner detected this.

2004-01-23 09:29  bagder

	  defined

2004-01-22 15:37  bagder

2004-01-22 15:35  bagder

	  work?

2004-01-22 13:48  bagder

2004-01-22 13:46  bagder

	* CHANGES: header file fixing

2004-01-22 13:46  bagder

	* src/: config.h.in, main.c: use curl_off_t instead of off_t

2004-01-22 13:45  bagder

	* lib/: config-amigaos.h, dict.c, easy.c, file.c, ftp.c, http.c,
	  mprintf.c, setup.h, strtoofft.h, transfer.c, transfer.h, url.c,
	  urldata.h: use curl_off_t instead of off_t!

2004-01-22 13:01  bagder

	* configure.ac: Instead of checking the off_t size, we use the
	  source dir version of the curl.h header and then check for the
	  size of the curl_off_t type.

2004-01-22 12:56  bagder

	* include/curl/curl.h: s/not/note

2004-01-22 12:54  bagder

	* include/curl/curl.h: curl_off_t is the new type for large file
	  support HttpPost is not defined anymore

2004-01-22 12:54  bagder

	* lib/: formdata.h, url.c, urldata.h: use the proper type for
	  formposts, not the deprecated one

2004-01-22 12:53  bagder

	* lib/ftp.h: added the missing proto for the still unused quit
	  function

2004-01-22 11:17  bagder

	* TODO-RELEASE: updates

2004-01-21 09:52  bagder

	* COPYING: updated year

2004-01-21 09:51  bagder

	* tests/data/test96: removed Basic in the initial response to see
	  if it makes any difference in the failure frequency

2004-01-21 09:50  bagder

	* lib/ftp.c: use the proper timecond defines, not the obsolete ones
	  I've removed! ;-)

	  The initial QUIT-sending code is added, but not yet used due to
	  the issues previously mentioned on the mailing list.

2004-01-21 09:47  bagder

	* lib/transfer.c: use the proper timecond defines, not the obsolete
	  ones!

	* CHANGES: old timecond defines removed

2004-01-21 09:39  bagder

	* include/curl/curl.h: Removed defines with TIMECOND_ prefixes.
	  They have been obsolte since April 22 2002, and if this causes
	  anyone any problems now it is very easy to just add CURL_ to the
	  names. This corrects this name space pollution.

2004-01-21 08:46  bagder

	* docs/libcurl/curl_easy_setopt.3: clarified where VERBOSE output
	  goes

2004-01-19 23:16  bagder

	* CHANGES: David Byron's --trace fix

2004-01-19 23:15  bagder

	* src/main.c: David Byron cleaned up how --trace with no option was
	  treated, and also arguments in a config file without a required
	  parameter!

2004-01-19 16:41  bagder

	* CHANGES: two minor build quirks

2004-01-19 16:41  bagder

2004-01-16 13:40  bagder

	* tests/data/test96: added this test, this is basicly a copy of
	  test 91 but we return the first response with a size 5 instead of
	  size 0, to see if this has an impact on the failure frequency -
	  test 91 still fails occationally.

2004-01-16 10:17  bagder

	* src/main.c, lib/content_encoding.c, lib/ssluse.c, src/urlglob.c:
	  Gisle Vanem's patch for variables that "might be used
	  uninitialized"

	* acinclude.m4: Added escaping of the function name in the
	  AC_DEFUN() macros, so that automake 1.8+ stops complaining!

2004-01-15 11:38  bagder

	* docs/libcurl/curl_easy_setopt.3: Peter Sylvester's
	  CURLOPT_SSL_CTX_FUNCTION docs I reworded some of the intial
	  paragraphs to avoid 'NOTE2'

2004-01-15 11:21  bagder

	* RELEASE-NOTES: now compressed out of the box

2004-01-15 11:20  bagder

	* configure.ac: check for limits.h as well

2004-01-15 10:54  bagder

	* lib/connect.c: added missing parenthesis

2004-01-15 08:09  bagder

	* CHANGES: -lz fix

2003-12-08 14:37  bagder

2003-12-02 19:01  bagder

	* src/main.c, docs/curl.1: --ftp-pasv now overrides a previous
	  --ftpport option. We now also support it named "--ftp-port" as
	  the additional dash between the words is used in several other
	  options and this makes it more consistant.

2003-12-02 14:40  bagder

	* lib/: setup.h, transfer.c: If HAVE_MSG_NOSIGNAL is set, we use
	  MSG_NOSIGNAL when we call send() and recv() and we no longer
	  attempt to ignore the SIGPIPE signal.

	* configure.ac: check for MSG_NOSIGNAL

2003-12-02 07:25  bagder

2003-11-25 10:05  bagder

	  default), the auth phase is always considered done immediately as

2003-11-24 08:10  bagder

	* lib/url.c: Gaz Iqbal fixed a range string memory leak!

2003-11-24 08:08  bagder

	* lib/urldata.h: fixed wrong comment

2003-11-23 23:26  bagder

	* src/: Makefile.m32, Makefile.vc6: Gisle Vanem fixed the Windows
	  build

2003-11-23 16:36  bagder

	* include/curl/curl.h: FTPSSL support options and defines added

2003-11-20 15:16  bagder

	* lib/transfer.c: combine the two identical cases

2003-11-20 15:15  bagder

	* CHANGES: three more fixes

2003-11-20 10:53  bagder

	* lib/http.c: bail out properly on a 407 when we can't authenticate
	  basic, bug report #845247

2003-11-20 10:52  bagder

	* tests/data/: Makefile.am, test93: request a file over proxy
	  without credentials, and get a 407 back

2003-11-19 16:59  bagder

	* src/main.c: unconditional progressbarinit cures a windows crash

2003-11-19 15:36  bagder

	* lib/ftp.c: If a partial file has been read or written, force a
	  closure the existing connection to avoid re-use of it, since we
	  cannot know in what state it is.

2003-11-19 15:35  bagder

	* lib/url.c: respect bits.close even if an error already is set,
	  but make sure that the existing error is the one returned back

2003-11-19 09:21  bagder

	* docs/examples/: postit2.c, sepheaders.c: cut off old crappy win32
	  comments and use the proper global_init instead also removed very
	  old "require libcurl older than blablabla"

2003-11-19 09:20  bagder

	* docs/examples/persistant.c: cleaned up

2003-11-19 09:19  bagder

	* docs/examples/getinmemory.c: remove the wrong win32 comment and
	  use global_init

2003-11-17 06:23  bagder

	* CHANGES: Maciej W. Rozycki's configure patch

2003-11-17 06:23  bagder

	* configure.ac: Maciej W. Rozycki made this script use a cache
	  variable for the writable argv test. This way, the default can be
	  overridden better (for cross-compiles etc)

2003-11-15 11:29  bagder

	* lib/hostip.c: do ares_destroy() on the ares handle when we're
	  done in Curl_is_resolved()

2003-11-15 11:15  bagder

	* CHANGES: two

2003-11-15 11:00  bagder

	* lib/ssluse.c: Mathias Axelsson found a case where we free()d the
	  server certificate twice!

2003-11-14 12:56  bagder

	* lib/hostip.c: Siddhartha Prakash Jain found a case with a bad
	  resolve that we didn't properly bail out from, when using ares.

2003-11-13 14:39  bagder

	* RELEASE-NOTES: updated

2003-11-13 14:28  bagder

	* CHANGES, lib/connect.c: Peter Sylvester found a flaw in the
	  connect code for ipv6-enabled hosts.	I guess it seldomly happens
	  on linux and that's why it wasn't found before.  He used Solaris
	  to notice it.

	  I took the opportunity to rewrite the Curl_connecthost() slightly
	  to feature less duplicate code in the two different versions
	  (ipv4/ipv6).

2003-11-13 11:05  bagder

	* tests/runtests.pl: -n disables valgrind now

2003-11-13 08:43  bagder

	* lib/formdata.c: Default Content-Type for formparts has changed to
	  "application/octet-stream".  This seems more appropriate, and I
	  believe mozilla and the likes do this.

	  .html files now get text/html as Content-Type.

	  Pointed out in bug report #839806.

2003-11-13 08:33  bagder

	* lib/memdebug.c: don't log failed socket() calls

2003-11-13 08:14  bagder

	* src/main.c: Gisle Vanem added a flush to make the progress-bar
	  look better on windows (at least).

2003-11-12 15:34  bagder

	* docs/libcurl/curl_easy_setopt.3: mention it was added in 7.10.9

2003-11-12 15:33  bagder

	* docs/KNOWN_BUGS: a resume http upload bug

2003-11-11 15:30  bagder

	* CHANGES, docs/libcurl/curl_easy_setopt.3, include/curl/curl.h,
	  lib/netrc.c, lib/netrc.h, lib/url.c, lib/urldata.h: Added
	  CURLOPT_NETRC_FILE.

2003-11-10 10:28  bagder

	* lib/Makefile.am: Generate the ca-bundle.h file in the build dir
	  and not in the source dir, which works nicely since the build dir
	  is before the source dir in the include path.

2003-11-10 09:12  bagder

	* lib/ftp.c: After Sbastien Willemijns' bug report, we now check
	  the separators properly in the 229-reply servers respond on a
	  EPSV command and bail out better if the reply string is not valid
	  RFC2428-compliant.

2003-11-08 15:29  bagder

	* src/config.h.in: for the getpwuid() etc

2003-11-08 09:39  bagder

	* src/homedir.c: use char, not bool

2003-11-07 18:22  bagder

	* CHANGES: things happen even during slow days! ;-)

2003-11-07 18:19  bagder

	* src/main.c: do a normal free() of the homedir now

2003-11-07 18:17  bagder

	* src/: Makefile.am, config.h.in, homedir.c, homedir.h, main.c:
	  Based on Gisle Vanem's $HOME patch, we now attempt to find the
	  home dir in a slightly better way for more platforms. The $HOME
	  is only used for .curlrc atm, but the possible upcoming change of
	  .netrc treatment may also need the home dir.

2003-11-07 14:26  bagder

	* docs/libcurl/curl_easy_setopt.3: Removed references to the
	  no-longer existing PASSWDFUNCTION. That option existed in 7.10.7
	  and earlier, but has since been cut out.

2003-11-07 14:26  bagder

	* lib/urldata.h: remove the struct fields for the deprecated passwd
	  prompt callback

2003-11-07 14:23  bagder

	* docs/curl.1: explain the requirements for --negotiate, --ntlm and
	  --krb4

2003-11-07 10:15  bagder

	* docs/libcurl/curl_easy_setopt.3: mark options better

2003-11-07 09:06  bagder

	* testcurl.sh: Ralph Mitchell's update that allows this script to
	  take an existing directory name and build/run/test curl in there
	  instead of trying to update from CVS. Using this approach, this
	  script can be used to test daily tarballs etc.

2003-11-07 08:20  bagder

	* lib/libcurl.rc: the resource file itself

2003-11-07 08:13  bagder

	* lib/Makefile.vc6: removed the resource lines I shouldn't have
	  added in the firt place

2003-11-07 08:02  bagder

	* src/setup.h: define TRUE and FALSE here as some platforms don't
	  have them otherwise

2003-11-06 17:04  bagder

	* lib/Makefile.vc6: CURLDEBUG, no underscore

2003-11-06 16:09  bagder

	* lib/: Makefile.am, Makefile.m32, Makefile.vc6: Gisle Vanem's
	  libcurl.dll version info patch applied

2003-11-06 15:16  bagder

	* src/main.c: don't allow options that we KNOW can't be used

2003-11-06 14:51  bagder

	* docs/curl.1: mark all mentioned options better

2003-11-06 14:34  bagder

	* docs/curl.1: converted most .I lines to \fI ones

2003-11-06 14:31  bagder

	* docs/curl.1: egd, not edg

2003-11-06 14:07  bagder

	* tests/libtest/test.h: Define TRUE and FALSE unless already
	  present. I've moved away those definitions from the global curl
	  header and thus this needs to do it themselves.

2003-11-06 13:52  bagder

	* docs/libcurl/libcurl-errors.3: removed the _last since that is by
	  definition not an error code

2003-11-06 12:37  bagder

	* CHANGES: new defines for version info

2003-11-06 12:34  bagder

	* maketgz: Insert the major, minor and patch numbers into the
	  curl/curl.h header as well. Removed the depedency on perl.

2003-11-06 12:33  bagder

	* include/curl/curl.h: We offer the version number "in parts" as
	  well by introducing three new defines.

2003-11-06 09:35  bagder

	* CHANGES: things

2003-11-06 09:32  bagder

	* README: new mirror added

2003-11-06 09:15  bagder

	* docs/TheArtOfHttpScripting: updated somewhat

2003-11-06 08:55  bagder

	* lib/transfer.c: unitialized variable fix, reported by both Marty
	  Kuhrt and benjamin gerard

2003-11-06 08:42  bagder

	* lib/: Makefile.am, libcurl.framework.make, libcurl.plist: Mac OS
	  X framework build files, contributed by Matt Veenstra

2003-11-06 08:21  bagder

	* include/curl/curl.h, lib/setup.h: Moved the TRUE and FALSE
	  #defines to lib/setup.h instead, as they don't belong in the
	  public header file. They are not in our name space so we should
	  not set them globally.

2003-11-05 16:52  bagder

	* docs/libcurl/: curl_easy_cleanup.3, curl_easy_duphandle.3,
	  curl_easy_init.3, curl_escape.3: minor format edits

2003-11-05 16:51  bagder

	* docs/: Makefile.am, libcurl/Makefile.am: use roffit to make HTML
	  from man pages http://daniel.haxx.se/projects/roffit/

2003-11-04 14:30  bagder

	* docs/libcurl/libcurl.3: use .BR to refer to other man pages to
	  make it easier for parsers to know

2003-11-04 14:27  bagder

	* docs/libcurl/curl_easy_getinfo.3: consistant with other man pages

2003-11-04 14:03  bagder

	* docs/libcurl/libcurl-errors.3: .TP and .B replaced with .IP

2003-11-04 13:59  bagder

	* docs/curl.1: .IP instead of .TP and .B

2003-11-04 13:58  bagder

	* docs/curl.1: highlight more mentioned options

2003-11-04 13:55  bagder

	* docs/libcurl/curl_easy_setopt.3: Use .IP instead of .TP and .B
	  for each item.

2003-11-04 13:07  bagder

	* docs/libcurl/curl_easy_setopt.3: spell!

2003-11-04 08:24  bagder

	* CHANGES: three changes went in

2003-11-04 07:59  bagder

	* src/Makefile.vc6, lib/Makefile.vc6: Troels Walsted Hansen fixed
	  the MSVC makefiles to build fine on Windows.

2003-11-04 07:52  bagder

	* lib/Makefile.am: spellfix in the generated comment by Kevin Roth

2003-11-04 07:50  bagder

	* packages/Win32/cygwin/Makefile.am: Kevin Roth's fix to make
	  correct cygwin packages

2003-11-01 12:40  bagder

	* RELEASE-NOTES: blanked, starting all over again

2003-11-01 12:33  bagder

	* include/curl/curl.h: starting on 7.10.9 in CVS

2003-11-01 12:22  bagder

	* CHANGES: 7.10.8!

2003-10-31 23:17  bagder

	* CHANGES: ftp goes UTC

2003-10-31 22:43  bagder

	* lib/http.c: gmtime() really can't even return NULL, can it?

2003-10-31 22:37  bagder

	* tests/data/test141: back to GMT again

2003-10-31 22:36  bagder

	* lib/ftp.c: assume that MDTM returns the timestamp as UTC

2003-10-31 22:34  bagder

	* tests/runtests.pl: my own system had a bad valgrind, so check
	  that it works at least somewhat before we use it

2003-10-31 19:43  bagder

	* docs/curl.1: Debian bug report #218046, a minor typo.

2003-10-31 10:49  bagder

	* src/main.c: removed compiler warnings from my latest fix

2003-10-31 10:27  bagder

	* CHANGES: numerical options check

2003-10-31 10:22  bagder

	* src/main.c: Added a new parse-numeric-parameters function so that
	  options that take a numeric argument can better bail out if given
	  a weird parameter. This catches situations such as "-y -Y 2000"
	  or "-O -C [URL]" etc.

2003-10-31 09:08  bagder

	* maketgz: newer, nicer

2003-10-30 14:30  bagder

	* include/curl/curl.h: Set version string to -CVS. This string is
	  generated by maketgz at release- time.

2003-10-30 14:28  bagder

	* src/version.h: Make the CVS version clone the libcurl version
	  string, this is generated by the maketgz script so in releases
	  this is replaced by an actual string.

2003-10-30 14:07  bagder

	* src/.cvsignore, include/curl/.cvsignore: ignore .dist files here

2003-10-30 13:48  bagder

	* Makefile.am: Made the dist-hook more generic for adding more
	  files named .dist into the dist archive. Preparing for a new
	  maketgz.

2003-10-30 11:30  bagder

	* RELEASE-NOTES: --head on file://, some cleanups

2003-10-30 10:15  bagder

	* src/main.c: more help text cleanups

2003-10-30 10:13  bagder

	* lib/file.c: silly me, I was meaning to do this change already as
	  discussed on the libcurl list, we get the time in GMT and not
	  localtime

2003-10-30 10:08  bagder

	* CHANGES, docs/curl.1, lib/file.c: curl --head now reports info
	  "headers" on file:// URLs as well

2003-10-30 10:06  bagder

	* tests/data/test141: updated for the cut off GMT string

2003-10-30 10:06  bagder

	* lib/ftp.c: when getting headers only, stop pretending the
	  reported time is GMT, as it isn't. In fact, it might be, but we
	  have no idea.

2003-10-30 08:32  bagder

	* tests/server/sws.c: only use siginterrupt() if it really exists
	  on the platform

2003-10-30 08:31  bagder

	* configure.ac: Check for siginterrupt, used by the test suite web
	  server sws.

2003-10-30 08:13  bagder

	* lib/inet_pton.c: Only compile the ipv6-section for ipv6-enabled
	  libcurls. Should save us some trouble.

2003-10-30 08:08  bagder

	* acinclude.m4: Added proper #ifdef's for the #include files when
	  checking for in_addr_t, which made the test start working nicely
	  on BeOS. Shard verified it.

2003-10-29 17:27  bagder

	* tests/: ftpsserver.pl, httpsserver.pl, runtests.pl: Stop using
	  stunnel.pm, we pass in the path from the main script instead.
	  Also made it easier to stop the test suite with control-c.

2003-10-29 17:11  bagder

	* src/main.c: cleaned up the --help output. Tried to unify the
	  language. Shortened a bunch of explanations.

2003-10-29 10:53  bagder

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES, lib/url.c, tests/data/Makefile.am,
	  tests/data/test203: David Hull made the file: URL parser also
	  accept the somewhat sloppy file syntax: file:/path. I added test
	  case 203 to verify this.

2003-10-29 10:13  bagder

	* tests/Makefile.am: stunnel.pm is no more

2003-10-29 10:13  bagder

	* tests/runtests.pl: stunnel.pm is removed

2003-10-29 10:12  bagder

	* tests/runtests.pl: now check for and use valgrind, inserted and
	  modified the check for stunnel and we no longer use the
	  stunnel.pm

2003-10-29 10:12  bagder

	* tests/stunnel.pm: removed, functionality added to runtests.pl

2003-10-28 14:06  bagder

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES, lib/hostip.c: Another glibc resolve name
	  fix

2003-10-28 10:28  bagder

	* src/main.c: possibly uninitialized variable

2003-10-28 10:17  bagder

	* lib/url.c: overlapping memory chunks with strcpy(), detected by
	  the friendly valgrind

2003-10-27 07:40  bagder

	* tests/runtests.pl: slightly quieter torture test by default

2003-10-27 07:35  bagder

	* lib/sendf.c: James Bursa's fix to prevent failf() to write
	  outside its buffer boundary

2003-10-26 16:42  bagder

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES: James Bursa found an ERRORBUFFFER
	  overflow

2003-10-26 16:37  bagder

	* lib/mprintf.c: snprintf() made a single-byte buffer overflow, as
	  it could write a zero outside its given buffer. Discovered and
	  reported by James Bursa.

2003-10-25 08:03  bagder

	* tests/libtest/: lib503.c, lib504.c: avoid dependence on the order
	  of the fields in the timeval struct, pointed out by Gisle Vanem

2003-10-25 00:30  bagder

	* testcurl.sh: support building ares-enabled too

2003-10-24 23:58  bagder

	* tests/data/: Makefile.am, test92: tests the new -C - fix

2003-10-24 23:58  bagder

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES: HTTP resume fix

2003-10-24 23:54  bagder

	* lib/transfer.c: Resuming a download of an already downloaded
	  document, that is trying to get a range of a document beyond its
	  size, caused libcurl to "hang" until the server closed the
	  connection and then it returned error 18.

	  This is bad. This way, we don't return any error at all, which
	  isn't nice either, as we need to alert the app somehow that the
	  request range was out of size.

2003-10-24 23:27  bagder

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES: solaris build improvement

2003-10-24 23:26  bagder

	* configure.ac, lib/Makefile.am: Based on David Hull's fix in bug
	  report 804599, we now check for solaris and gcc, to set the
	  -mimpure-text link flag for linking the lib better.

2003-10-24 22:58  bagder

	* tests/libtest/: lib503.c, lib504.c: don't select() forever, set a
	  timeout so at least the test fails nice

2003-10-24 22:39  bagder

	* tests/data/test503: better name, it isn't https

2003-10-24 22:30  bagder

	* ares/CHANGES: c-ares is the new name and ares_version() was added

2003-10-24 22:28  bagder

	* ares/: Makefile.in, ares_version.c, ares_version.h: Introducing
	  ares_version(), so that we can have apps get version info about
	  what particular ares version that is being used.

2003-10-24 22:21  bagder

	* tests/data/test91: make it work with Negotiate support enabled
	  too

2003-10-24 15:12  bagder

	* CHANGES: runtests -t introduced

2003-10-24 15:00  bagder

	* tests/runtests.pl: improved the torture testing

2003-10-24 14:59  bagder

	* tests/memanalyze.pl: supports -l now to display the actual line
	  that was prevented by memlimit

2003-10-24 14:58  bagder

	* lib/ftp.c: if malloc fails, we must bail out nicely

2003-10-24 14:58  bagder

	* lib/http.c: Improved checks for bad memory situations and proper
	  behaviour when we run out of memory.

2003-10-24 14:57  bagder

	* lib/hostip.c: better bailing-out cleanup if a malloc fails in the
	  DNS cache

2003-10-24 14:56  bagder

	* src/main.c: free all memory on failure before bailing out, not
	  really necessary but my upcoming automated test gets crazy if not

2003-10-24 10:56  bagder

	* RELEASE-NOTES: the actual release-notes is new too

2003-10-24 10:53  bagder

	* tests/runtests.pl: Introducing -t to "torture" the memory
	  allocations/failing/bail-outing in curl and libcurl. -t is not
	  used anywhere automated yet, and it does already identify memory
	  leaks on failed allocations. Work to do.

2003-10-24 10:09  bagder

	* tests/memanalyze.pl: produce a single summary of the amount of
	  allocations on -v

2003-10-24 08:12  bagder

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES: disable-eprt, fixed CA cert verfication

2003-10-23 09:46  bagder

	* src/main.c: Georg Horn's patch. -k is no longer mutually
	  exclusive with --cacert and --capath. Using -k together with one
	  of those just means that the result of the CA cert check is
	  ignored (but displayed if -v is used).

2003-10-23 09:44  bagder

	* lib/ssluse.c: Georg Horn's fixes to do different CA cert
	  verifications. They can now be done even if the result is
	  ignored, as some sites seem to require that.

2003-10-22 16:37  bagder

	* docs/curl.1: encourage use of -c to store cookies instead of -D

2003-10-22 14:46  bagder

	* tests/runtests.pl: allow gdb to check the libtest dir for sources
	  too (for the 500- tests)

2003-10-22 14:05  bagder

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES: we continue to improve things

2003-10-22 13:56  bagder

	* src/main.c: make --disable-eprt work, based on Gisle Vanem's
	  patch

2003-10-22 13:26  bagder

	* Makefile.dist: Dylan Ellicott added the vc-libcurl-ssl-dll target

2003-10-22 13:26  bagder

	* lib/Makefile.vc6: Dylan Ellicott added the
	  release-libcurl-ssl-dll target

2003-10-22 13:15  bagder

	* lib/transfer.c: Do the auth stuff at the end-of-headers and not
	  at the start-of-body, as we might not get a body when we get a
	  401 with a set of WWW-Authenticate: headers. This fixes the
	  problem Kevin Roth detected in 7.10.8-pre4 and pre5.	Verified by
	  test case 91.

	* lib/http_ntlm.c: make no user or no password just mean blank
	  fields, not aborted operation

2003-10-17 11:28  bagder

	* tests/data/test16: finally we support >128 letter passwords so
	  this test was fixed to work

2003-10-17 11:28  bagder

	* lib/url.c: o the name and password arrays are 256 bytes, so let's
	  accept that lengthy	input o have ->passwd and ->name be NULL if
	  no name/passwd was given o only set default user+password for FTP
	  if no userpwd was given

2003-10-17 11:26  bagder

	* lib/ftp.c: made the code deal with empty name and password

2003-10-17 09:10  bagder

	* lib/http.c: show info text (verbose) about auth type and user
	  name in use

2003-10-17 09:04  bagder

	* src/main.c: made the password prompt nicer

2003-10-17 08:59  bagder

	* src/config.h.in: define HAVE_SYS_SOCKET_H if that file is

	  ntlm

2003-10-16 16:09  bagder

	* src/: Makefile.am, config.h.in, getpass.c, getpass.h, main.c:
	  Added support for password prompting if only used name is given
	  on the command line.

2003-10-16 16:08  bagder

	* lib/Makefile.am, lib/getpass.c, lib/getpass.h, lib/transfer.c,
	  lib/url.c, include/curl/curl.h: password promting support removed
	  from libcurl

	* lib/ssluse.c: rewritten alternative name check

2003-10-15 22:37  bagder

	* lib/connect.c: the previous fix left this compiler error

2003-10-15 16:42  bagder

	* lib/ssluse.c: bad license situation for the altname patch

2003-10-15 13:44  bagder

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES: now libcurl runs better multi-threaded on
	  windows

2003-10-15 13:42  bagder

	* lib/connect.c: Avoid doing getsockopt() on Windows to verify
	  connects. It seems that this hogs Windows machines when libcurl
	  is being used multi-threaded (with > ~50 threads). Andrew Fuller
	  helped us verify and test this.

	  According to a MSDN web page on connect(), it returns 0 when the
	  connect is done and thus we don't need the getsockopt() call
	  anyway on Windows.

2003-10-14 15:13  bagder

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES: duphandle fix

2003-10-14 15:10  bagder

	* lib/easy.c: Kimmo Kinnunen fixed a crash with duphandle() when

	  on Windows

2003-10-14 14:00  bagder

	  progress.c, sendf.c, setup.h, speedcheck.c, telnet.c, timeval.c,
	  timeval.h, transfer.c, url.c: Gisle Vanem's IPv6-on-Windows patch
	  applied!

2003-10-14 13:27  bagder

	* buildconf: improved the libtool check to disqualify "1.4c" when
	  1.4.2 is required

2003-10-14 10:19  bagder

	* RELEASE-NOTES: Added Domenico Andreoli for his patches

2003-10-13 15:10  bagder

	* lib/README.ares: added more mirrored versions of the ares 1.1.1
	  package

2003-10-13 15:07  bagder

	* lib/README.ares: Updated build instruction since I now offer a
	  complete ares-package with all the patches already applied. No
	  need to apply any patches manually anymore.

	  ares 1.1.1 is still compatible.

2003-10-13 14:24  bagder

	* CHANGES: Giuseppe Attardi's ares+multi problem of 12-oct-2003

2003-10-13 14:21  bagder

	* lib/multi.c: Clear the connection pointer after the async resolve
	  has failed.  This cures the problem reported by Giuseppe Attardi
	  on October 12, 2003.

2003-10-13 02:14  bagder

	* CHANGES: debian bug report #212086

	  by Domenico Andreoli.

2003-10-13 02:10  bagder

	* docs/: Makefile.am, libcurl/Makefile.am: use $(NROFF), not gnroff
	  (patch by Domenico Andreoli)

2003-10-12 15:58  bagder

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES: Dirk modifide the share-locking for DNS
	  lookups

2003-10-12 15:57  bagder

	* lib/hostip.c, tests/data/test506: Dirk Manske made the
	  share-locking around DNS lookups a bit "looser" so that multiple
	  DNS lookups can run simultaneously faster. The downside is that
	  resolving the same host name now can be made at once from
	  multiple threads, but the upside is that threads now don't alwys
	  have to wait for the others' resolves. Test case 506 updated
	  accordingly.

2003-10-09 22:12  bagder

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES: resume fix

2003-10-09 22:04  bagder

	* lib/url.c: Lachlan O'Dea fixed a resume problem: "If I set

	  CURLOPT_RESUME_FROM to 0, the next download still has a Range
	  header with a garbage value." bug report #820502

2003-10-09 21:49  bagder

	* CHANGES: sws fix, inet_pton fix

2003-10-09 10:19  bagder

	* lib/inet_pton.c: Dominick Meglio fixed this to build fine on MSVC

2003-10-09 10:12  bagder

	* tests/server/: Makefile.am, sws.c: portability fix by using
	  setup.h from the lib directory

2003-10-09 10:09  bagder

	* configure.ac: removed creation of tests/server/config.h

2003-10-09 10:08  bagder

2003-10-08 15:07  bagder

	* lib/: inet_pton.c, inet_pton.h: include file fixes

2003-10-08 15:06  bagder

2003-10-07 23:46  bagder

	* lib/: Makefile.am, inet_pton.c, inet_pton.h, ssluse.c:   Neil
	  Dunbar provided a patch that now makes libcurl check SSL
	    subjectAltNames when matching certs. This is apparently
	  detailed in RFC2818
	    as the right thing to do. I had to add configure checks for
	  inet_pton() and
	    our own (strictly speaking, code from BIND written by Paul
	  Vixie) provided
	    code for the function for platforms that miss it.

2003-10-07 16:43  bagder

	* tests/: data/Makefile.am, data/test508, libtest/Makefile.am,
	  libtest/lib508.c: test case 508 added to test callback-based POST

2003-10-07 16:42  bagder

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES: http post fix

2003-10-07 16:39  bagder

	* lib/http.c: make sure that a regular POST using the read callback
	  works

2003-10-07 00:03  bagder

	* acinclude.m4: O_NONBLOCK does not work on BeOS according to Shard

2003-10-05 17:16  bagder

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES: builds better on BeOS

2003-10-05 17:05  bagder

	* src/setup.h: Shard's fix to build fine on BeOS

2003-10-05 17:04  bagder

	* lib/setup.h: BeOS-adjustments, as provided by Shard

2003-10-05 17:03  bagder

2003-10-05 17:03  bagder

	* lib/hostip.c: just re-indented some code

2003-10-05 17:02  bagder

	* lib/connect.c: New code for BeOS-style non-blocking sockets,
	  provided by Shard and Jeremy Friesner.

2003-10-05 10:35  bagder

	* acinclude.m4: improved the non-block check a lot: * several tests
	  ALWAYS failed due to bad test programs * the IoctlSocket() test
	  now is linked on test as it could otherwise compile	fine on
	  many systems that doesn't support it * added a test for the BeOS
	  way of doing non-blocking sockets (based on a   patch from Shard)

2003-10-04 17:52  bagder

	* CHANGES: curlx.c example added

2003-10-04 17:51  bagder

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES: - Vincent Bronner pointed out that if you
	  set CURLOPT_COOKIE for a transfer   and then set it to NULL in a
	  subsequent one, the previous cookie was still   sent off!

2003-10-04 17:48  bagder

	* lib/http.c: Vincent Bronner pointed out that if you set
	  CURLOPT_COOKIE to NULL, it still sends off the previously set
	  cookie. This also concerns CURLOPT_REFERER.  This fix should stop
	  this.

2003-10-04 17:28  bagder

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES: Jon Turner fix

2003-10-04 17:25  bagder

	* lib/ftp.c: Jon Turner mentioned this bug fix to correct how
	  libcurl deals with paths after a failed transfer.

2003-10-04 16:53  bagder

	* CHANGES, RELEASE-NOTES: fixed ares-resolves and ip-only names

2003-10-04 16:50  bagder

	* lib/: hostip.c, hostip.h, multi.c: Based on a patch provided by
	  Siddhartha Prakash Jain. In Curl_resolv() when my_getaddrinfo()
	  has been called (and wait has been set to TRUE), we check if the
	  name already is resolved and if so don't return wait status to
	  the parent. This can happen with IP-only names.

2003-10-04 16:01  bagder

	* docs/libcurl/curl_easy_setopt.3: CURLOPT_NOBODY means HEAD on
	  HTTP servers

2003-10-03 15:46  bagder

	  code.

2003-09-22 23:42  bagder

	* RELEASE-NOTES: cut the leading blurb, that will be used for the
	  mail announce only, not the actual text included here

2003-09-22 23:39  bagder

	* Makefile.am: Include the RELEASE-NOTES file too, which is basicly
	  the release announce message.

2003-09-22 23:38  bagder

	* CHANGES: another segfault with multi+ares+non-existing hostname

2003-09-22 01:10  bagder

	* lib/multi.c: failing to resolve a name using ares must
	  Curl_disconnect() the handle properly or risk getting into
	  trouble!

2003-09-22 00:13  bagder

	* configure.ac: find and detect the Heimdal GSSAPI include path
	  properly

2003-09-19 17:16  bagder

	* CHANGES, include/curl/curl.h, lib/hostip.c, lib/urldata.h: Added

	* lib/url.c: If a connection is closed down and it had some kind of
	  NTLM involved, we reset the authentication state to make it
	  restart on the next connection.

	  This of course because NTLM is connection-oriented, whilst all
	  other authentication schemes are not.

2003-09-16 00:29  bagder

	* tests/data/: Makefile.am, test90: Test 90 added: --anyauth that
	  picks NTLM with a redirect and then another NTLM request.

2003-09-15 23:43  bagder

	* tests/FILEFORMAT: minor difference in how the part number magic
	  is made

2003-09-15 23:42  bagder

	* tests/server/sws.c: make the NTLM part numbers get increased
	  instead of plainly assigned, as this then makes redirection tests
	  work (as the new test 89)

2003-09-15 23:41  bagder

	* tests/data/: Makefile.am, test89: test 89 verifies -L and ntlm
	  authentication, as bug report #806328 claimed it doesn't work. It
	  works for me.

2003-09-15 23:11  bagder

	* tests/data/: Makefile.am, test88: test88, doing PUT with --digest
	  now works

2003-09-15 23:11  bagder

	* lib/: http.c, http_ntlm.c, http_ntlm.h: When we issue a HTTP
	  request, first make sure if the authentication phase is over or
	  not, as if it isn't we shall not begin any PUT or POST operation.

	  This cures bug report #805853, and test case 88 verifies it!

2003-09-15 00:42  bagder

	* lib/README.ares: new ares patch uploaded

2003-09-15 00:06  bagder

	* CHANGES: Jeff Pohlmeyer is our hero of the week!

2003-09-14 23:24  bagder

	* lib/Makefile.am: reverted the change that blanks LIBS

2003-09-14 23:17  bagder

	* lib/: hash.c, hash.h, hostip.c: Jeff Pohlmeyer did some marvelous
	  debugging to track this one down. We MUST NOT free the existing
	  hash entry when we try to add a new one that matches an existing
	  entry. We now instead free the new one, and make the parent
	  function use the old entry's struct instead.

2003-09-12 22:45  bagder

	* lib/Makefile.am: blank the LIBS variable, as we don't need any
	  libs when we link the lib.

2003-09-12 20:35  bagder

	* docs/libcurl/curl_easy_setopt.3: Added more docs for
	  DEBUGFUNCTION as suggsted by Mohun Biswas

	  zero-length proxy with ftp and an uninitialized pointer

2003-09-12 17:44  bagder

	* CHANGES: clear the proxy env

2003-09-12 17:41  bagder

	* tests/runtests.pl: When people have environment variables set for
	  protocol proxies, we must make sure to clear them before we run
	  the tests as they interfere badly otherwise.

2003-09-12 00:21  bagder

	* lib/: http.c, http_negotiate.c, urldata.h: Tim Bartley's patch
	  that makes the GSSNEGOTIATE option work for Microsoft's
	  "Negotiate" authentication as well.

2003-09-12 00:14  bagder

	* lib/multi.c: For easy handles within multi handles, we share the
	  DNS cache always.

2003-09-12 00:13  bagder

	* lib/llist.c: #ifdef 0'ed Curl_llist_insert_prev and
	  Curl_llist_remove_next, as they are not used by any code in
	  libcurl!

2003-09-12 00:05  bagder

	* lib/ftp.c: don't use a blank proxy

2003-09-11 23:27  bagder

	* lib/hostip.c: Curl_is_resolved(): FD_ZERO the file descriptors
	  before we call ares_fds().  Problem tracked down by Bjorn Reese.

2003-09-08 01:31  bagder

	* CHANGES, include/curl/curl.h, src/version.h: 7.10.8-pre1 commit

2003-09-07 17:00  bagder

	* lib/md5.c: do not use 'long' to store 4 bytes, as 64bit
	  architectures have 64bit longs.

2003-09-05 16:34  bagder

	* CHANGES: yesterday and today in words

2003-09-05 14:44  bagder

	* lib/: hash.c, llist.c, llist.h: Uses less macros. #ifdef'ed out
	  unused functions. Edited slightly to be more in the same style as
	  other curl source code. The only actual code change is an added
	  check after a malloc() call.

2003-09-05 13:02  bagder

	* docs/libcurl/curl_easy_setopt.3: Early Ehlinger's
	  CURLOPT_FTP_RESPONSE_TIMEOUT option documented by himself.

2003-09-05 11:53  bagder

	* configure.ac: --enable-thread was broken and this should cure it
	  Kevin Fisk reported.

2003-09-04 15:32  bagder

	* include/curl/curl.h: CURLINFO_HTTPAUTH_AVAIL and
	  CURLINFO_PROXYAUTH_AVAIL

2003-09-04 15:31  bagder

	* lib/http_ntlm.c: no user or password set, bail out

2003-09-04 15:07  bagder

	* lib/http.c: ah, this change broke multiple test cases

2003-09-04 13:34  bagder

	* lib/http.c: Jrg pointed out that I did this fix wrongly, now
	  authwant is cleared properly if no auth is available

2003-09-04 12:55  bagder

	* lib/: getinfo.c, http.c, urldata.h: Based on Joerg Mueller-Tolk's
	  patch, this introduces support for CURLINFO_HTTPAUTH_AVAIL and
	  CURLINFO_PROXYAUTH_AVAIL

2003-09-04 12:18  bagder

	* lib/http.c: 1. store the httpproxycode in the loop after it is
	  parsed 2. made Curl_http_auth_act() reset 'authavail'
	  unconditionally

2003-09-04 12:08  bagder

	* lib/http.c: avoid proxy (and other) auth if no user+password is
	  given

2003-09-04 12:04  bagder

	* lib/libcurl.def: added the missing share-functions, pointed out
	  by Edward Chan

2003-09-04 00:02  bagder

	* CHANGES, include/curl/curl.h, lib/ftp.c, lib/url.c,
	  lib/urldata.h: Early Ehlinger's CURLOPT_FTP_RESPONSE_TIMEOUT
	  patch applied.

2003-09-03 23:52  bagder

	  negotiations needed for NTLM, Digest etc.

2003-09-03 23:47  bagder

	* lib/url.c: Joerg Mueller-Tolk's fix to better deal with
	  user+passwords for proxies

2003-09-03 23:44  bagder

	* lib/ftp.c: minor fix to make better bail-out check

2003-09-03 22:47  bagder

	* lib/ssluse.c: warn if no CN is available if verify is only set to
	  1

2003-09-03 22:42  bagder

	* CHANGES: stuff I had added in my copy at home, now at last I'm
	  online from here again

2003-09-03 17:37  bagder

	* tests/server/getpart.c: Peter Pentchev found two problems. One
	  realloc problem that could allocate too little data, and one case
	  of not zero-terminating the returned string.

	  I chose a slightly different patch than the one Peter provided.

2003-09-02 09:48  bagder

	* lib/http_digest.c: wrap at 80 cols

2003-09-01 10:57  bagder

	* CHANGES: two patches applied

2003-09-01 10:43  bagder

	  Storner)

2003-09-01 10:21  bagder

	* lib/hostip.c: The error buffer was not getting filled when

	* lib/version.c: typecase to please the compiler gods

2003-08-29 10:43  bagder

	* lib/transfer.c: typecast to prevent compiler warning

2003-08-28 13:28  bagder

	* lib/url.c: CURLOPT_BUFFERSIZE must not be smaller than 0 (zero)
	  as that is impossible for us to deal with

2003-08-28 13:21  bagder

	* docs/examples/multi-app.c: Henrik Storner's rewrite that includes
	  a nice usage of curl_multi_info_read()

2003-08-28 12:39  bagder

	* lib/Makefile.am: only do chmod if there's a file present

2003-08-24 16:29  bagder

	* lib/strequal.c: added the strcasecmp() proto here (moved from
	  setup.h), as this is the only file within libcurl to use that
	  function

2003-08-24 16:28  bagder

	* lib/setup.h: removed the strcasecmp() proto from here, and moved
	  it to the strequal.c file instead

2003-08-22 14:56  bagder

	* docs/curl.1: we support any number of globs now, even for #[num]
	  ones

2003-08-22 14:35  bagder

	* lib/ftp.c: have cwd_and_mkd prefixed with ftp_ to make it appear
	  as a ftp-only function

2003-08-22 14:25  bagder

	* lib/hostip.c: use proper type to prevent compiler warning

2003-08-21 14:07  bagder

	* lib/hostip.c: Vincent Sanders provided a fix for name resolving
	  when linked with uClibc.

2003-08-20 17:44  bagder

	  even when it returns NULL!

2003-08-20 01:42  bagder

	* CHANGES: recent action

2003-08-20 01:42  bagder

	* src/main.c: Now offering support for multiple -T on the same
	  command line, just make sure you have one URL for each -T. A -T
	  file name can also be "globbed" like -T "{file1,file2}".

	  Test case 149 verifies this functionality.

2003-08-20 01:38  bagder

	* tests/data/Makefile.am: test case 149 is here

2003-08-20 01:38  bagder

2003-08-20 01:23  bagder

	* lib/hostip.c: make sure the 'done' variable is always set to
	  something in the Curl_is_resolved() function

2003-08-19 17:38  bagder

	* configure.ac: when --enable-debug is used to set debug options
	  with gcc, use -Wno-long-long to inhibit long long warnings (ISO
	  C90 does not support `long long')

2003-08-19 17:37  bagder

	* lib/mprintf.c: Respect HAVE_LONGLONG to support 'long long'

2003-08-19 11:56  bagder

	* configure.ac: check for CRYPTO_cleanup_all_ex_data as well

2003-08-19 11:56  bagder

	* lib/ssluse.c: CRYPTO_cleanup_all_ex_data() is not present in all
	  OpenSSL versions so we need to check for its presence in the
	  configure script

2003-08-19 11:38  bagder

	* tests/libtest/.cvsignore: better ignore pattern

2003-08-19 11:37  bagder

	  host name

2003-08-19 11:36  bagder

	* tests/data/: Makefile.am, test507: test507 added

2003-08-19 11:29  bagder

	* lib/hostip.c: don't set done==TRUE if the host name doesn't
	  resolve

2003-08-19 09:51  bagder

	* lib/ssluse.c: Loren Kirkby pointed out that we need to call
	  CRYPTO_cleanup_all_ex_data() when we cleanup the SSL stuff to not
	  leak any memory.

	  I wish this was documented anywhere.

2003-08-18 17:27  bagder

	* docs/CONTRIBUTE: minor edit

2003-08-18 17:24  bagder

	  #if 0 so far.

2003-08-14 17:06  bagder

	* lib/llist.c: Curl_llist_destroy() checks the input for non-NULL

	* lib/hash.h: new proto for Curl_hash_init

2003-08-14 17:05  bagder

2003-08-14 16:19  bagder

	* lib/: memdebug.c, memdebug.h: allow out-of-memory testing by
	  setting a limit. That number of memory allocation calls will
	  succeed, the following will return NULL!

2003-08-14 15:38  bagder

	* src/main.c: better freeing when bailing out due to bad output
	  glob

2003-08-14 15:37  bagder

	* tests/.cvsignore: ignore the .pid files

2003-08-14 15:00  bagder

	* tests/libtest/.cvsignore: ignore lib506 too

2003-08-14 14:59  bagder

	* tests/runtests.pl: better report on why tests are skipped, and
	  also show a count of the amount of test cases that were
	  "considered".

2003-08-14 13:53  bagder

	* src/main.c: In case the output urlglob file name returned is
	  NULL, then there was badness in the string and we help our user
	  by returning an error.

2003-08-14 13:53  bagder

	* src/urlglob.c: modified the #[num] code to be more robust, to
	  return NULL on errors and to support numbers larger than 9

	* tests/data/test74: corrected this test case

2003-08-14 13:50  bagder

	  corrected the CURLOPT_FILE referer, as we nowadays call it
	  CURLOPT_WRITEDATA.

	  regular authentication

2003-08-11 12:34  bagder

	  available for other options, more frequently used, in a future
	  release

2003-08-11 12:12  bagder

	* tests/data/: Makefile.am, test46, test79: added test 79, a basic
	  test that fetches an FTP URL over a HTTP proxy

2003-08-11 11:56  bagder

	* lib/: cookie.h, easy.c, sendf.c, share.c, transfer.c, url.c: the
	  new cookie functions that require 'data' passed in

	* lib/http.c: support sending off cookies without contents

2003-08-11 11:55  bagder

	* lib/cookie.c: Added some infof() calls, that require the data
	  pointer so now several cookie functions need that.

	  I also fixed the cookie loader to properly load and deal with
	  cookies without contents (or rather with a blank content).

2003-08-11 09:30  bagder

	* tests/ftpserver.pl: Support COUNT in the control file, to set the
	  number of times the custom REPLY is to be sent back before

2003-08-08 11:55  bagder

	* lib/ftp.c: re-arranged the cwd/mkd stuff a bit

2003-08-08 11:13  bagder

	* tests/Makefile.am: added CLEANFILES to make distcheck run fine

2003-08-07 15:20  bagder

	* src/main.c: infilesize must be a long to work on 64bit archs

2003-08-07 08:43  bagder

	* lib/Makefile.am, src/Makefile.am: use 644 for the chmod

2003-08-07 01:59  bagder

	* lib/Makefile.am: argh, it wasn't *that* easy to generate the
	  ca-bundle header in the build dir instead of the source dir,
	  reverting that change

2003-08-07 01:56  bagder

	* tests/data/Makefile.am: fixed syntax error

2003-08-07 01:48  bagder

	* src/main.c: better cleaning up of memory in case of failures in
	  the get-loop (it was taken care of by the exit-free anyway but
	  caused test case 75 and 76 to report memory leaks).

	  Also re-indented a small section.

2003-08-07 01:47  bagder

	* src/urlglob.c: better cleaning up allocated memory in case of
	  failures

2003-08-07 01:45  bagder

	* tests/data/: Makefile.am, test74, test75, test76: more tests

2003-08-07 01:10  bagder

	  is sent to the test server(s)

2003-08-07 00:32  bagder

	* lib/mprintf.c: fix the treatment of the variable width specifier
	  '*', which caused a bug in the urlglobbing just now, fixed in the
	  debian bug tracker as Bug#203827

2003-08-07 00:15  bagder

	* Makefile.am: make an uninstall hook in the same manner we already
	  did an install hook as otherwise will make distcheck fail

2003-08-07 00:14  bagder

	* src/Makefile.am: chmod the hugehelp.c in the dist hook to make
	  distcheck run fine

2003-08-07 00:14  bagder

	* lib/Makefile.am: generate the ca-bundle.h in the build dir, and
	  also make sure to chmod the file in the dist-hook to make

2003-08-06 23:23  bagder

	* docs/libcurl/libcurl-multi.3: Domenico Andreoli fixed the section
	  number in the main meta data

	* lib/: http.c, transfer.c: include "share.h" for the cookie
	  sharing

2003-08-06 17:26  bagder

	* lib/hostip.c: make it build without ares support make sure it set
	  async false even when using ipv6 (made test case 20 fail before)

2003-08-06 15:49  bagder

	* tests/data/Makefile.am: 505 was missing

2003-08-06 15:22  bagder

2003-08-05 16:54  bagder

	* lib/Makefile.am: added README.ares

2003-08-05 16:52  bagder

	* lib/README.ares: how to build with ares

2003-08-05 16:40  bagder

	* lib/: Makefile.am, connect.c, ftp.c, hostip.c, hostip.h, multi.c,
	  setup.h, transfer.c, url.c, url.h, urldata.h: ares
	  awareness/usage/support added. If configure --enable-ares is
	  used, we build libcurl to use ares for asynch name resolves.

2003-08-05 15:37  bagder

	* configure.ac: Add --enable-ares support, which will make us build
	  curl with ares for asynch name resolves. Still very experimental,
	  beware!

2003-08-05 15:04  bagder

	* lib/ftp.c: clean up the dir tree hierarchy in *_done() to make
	  persistant connection FTP use the correct directories!

	  Reported in bug report #783116

2003-08-05 15:00  bagder

	  as reported on the list

2003-08-05 14:59  bagder

	* tests/data/test146: persistant connection test

2003-08-05 14:32  bagder

	* docs/KNOWN_BUGS: auth problems

2003-08-05 01:13  bagder

	* tests/Makefile.am: cleaned up after David Byron's comment on the
	  libcurl list, aug 5 2003

2003-08-05 01:05  bagder

	* lib/cookie.c:   Jan Sundin reported a case where curl ignored a
	  cookie that browsers don't,
	    which turned up to be due to the number of dots in the
	  'domain'. I've now
	    made curl follow the the original netscape cookie spec less
	  strict on that
	    part.

2003-08-05 00:58  bagder

	* tests/data/Makefile.am: added test 73

2003-08-05 00:57  bagder

	* tests/data/test73: Verifies Jan Sundin's cookie bug, dated aug 4
	  2003.

2003-08-04 17:02  bagder

	* lib/: easy.c, http.c, share.c, share.h, transfer.c, url.c: Dirk
	  Manske's patch that introduces cookie support to the share
	  interface.

2003-08-04 00:18  bagder

	* lib/http_chunks.c:  Mark Fletcher provided an excellent bug
	  report that identified a problem
	   with FOLLOWLOCATION and chunked transfer-encoding, as libcurl
	  would not
	   properly ignore the body contents of 3XX response that included
	  the
	   Location: header.

2003-08-03 23:33  bagder

	* CHANGES: serios info leakage!

2003-08-03 01:36  bagder

	* lib/http.c: When proxy authentication is used in a CONNECT
	  request (as used for all SSL connects and otherwise enforced
	  tunnel-thru-proxy requests), the same authentication header is
	  also wrongly sent to the remote host.

	  The name and password can then be captured by an evil host and
	  possibly get used for malicious purposes.

2003-08-03 01:35  bagder

	* tests/data/test503: updated as the second proxy-auth header was a
	  proof of a serious info leak bug!!

2003-08-01 16:20  bagder

	* docs/MANUAL: Joerg Mueller-Tolk fixed a minor mistake

2003-08-01 14:33  bagder

	* CHANGES: recent action

2003-08-01 09:53  bagder

	* docs/INSTALL, src/Makefile.vc6: David Byron's makefile fix to
	  allow 7.10.6 to build fine using VC

2003-07-30 17:10  bagder

	* configure.ac: add a check for 'ar' since the lack of it bit Jared
	  Ingersoll we might need to check for some other tools too that on
	  Solaris are put in those weird dirs...

2003-07-30 16:26  bagder

	* src/Makefile.vc6: removed silly target that only works when
	  building from CVS

2003-07-30 16:19  bagder

	* lib/Makefile.vc6: Jrg Mller-Tolk updated this to build fine
	  with 7.10.6

2003-07-30 15:41  bagder

	* docs/TODO: ftp proxy support would be nice

2003-07-30 09:52  bagder

	* tests/data/: test104, test141: updated to match the recent ftp
	  patch that makes it check for resumability

2003-07-30 09:51  bagder

	* lib/ftp.c: Daniel Noguerol made the ftp code output
	  "Accept-Ranges: bytes" in similar style like other faked HTTP
	  headers when NOBODY and HEADER are used.

2003-07-30 09:33  bagder

	* src/Makefile.am: Make sure to generate an uncompressed hugehelp.c
	  file for inclusion in the distribution archive, as it isn't sure
	  zlib is present everywhere. Those who care much for compressed
	  help should regenerate the file.

2003-07-30 09:22  bagder

	* lib/: ftp.c, urldata.h: Reverted the 'filetime' struct field back
	  to a 'long' as time_t is sometimes unsigned and we want this to
	  be able to hold -1 for illegal/unset values.

2003-07-29 13:07  bagder

	* src/setup.h: CURLDEBUG not MALLOCDEBUG

2003-07-29 01:00  bagder

	* src/mkhelp.pl: Fixes based on Gisle Vanem's input since this
	  script failed due to possibly crlf newlines.

2003-07-29 00:17  bagder

	* tests/data/: Makefile.am, test72: Digest *OR* Basic authorization
	  test

2003-07-28 14:13  bagder

	* CHANGES, include/curl/curl.h, src/version.h: 7.10.6

2003-07-28 12:21  bagder

	* lib/http.c: clear http->send_buffer when we have freed the memory
	  it pointed to

2003-07-28 11:02  bagder

	* tests/data/test106: updated to the new ftp dir parsing code that
	  allows a preceeding double slash

2003-07-28 10:53  bagder

	* docs/MANUAL: As noticed by Kevin Roth, we shall not speak of root
	  dir when it isn't necessarily the root...

2003-07-28 10:50  bagder

	* lib/ftp.c: Franois Pons brought a patch that once again made
	  curl deal with ftp and "double slash" as indicating the root
	  directory. In the RFC1738-fix of April 30, that ability was
	  removed (since it is not the "right" way).

2003-07-28 10:23  bagder

	* tests/data/test71: use the correct 'test71' file name for the
	  temp file

2003-07-28 10:21  bagder

	* tests/data/: Makefile.am, test71: got a bug report on -F in
	  config files, so I wrote up this test to verify that is works...
	  and it did! ;-)

2003-07-25 11:46  bagder

	* lib/ca-bundle.h: having it in CVS causes us problems *grrr*

2003-07-25 10:59  bagder

	* lib/Makefile.m32, src/Makefile.m32: Andrs Garca updated with
	  the added files etc

2003-07-25 10:47  bagder

	* lib/Makefile.am: With an unknown CA path, we undef the variable.
	  To build properly without SSL/CA.

2003-07-25 10:47  bagder

	* configure.ac: only check for CA bundle path if build with SSL
	  support set a conditional for the makefile if we know the CA path
	  or not

2003-07-25 10:30  bagder

	* lib/: dict.c, easy.c, file.c, http.c, telnet.c, transfer.c,
	  url.c: Removed #include <sys/resource.h>, as pointed out by Henry
	  Bland we don't need it.

2003-07-23 19:28  bagder

	* testcurl.sh: the test compared numericly if though it could
	  contain a string, and I lowered the number of retries to 10

2003-07-23 19:06  bagder

	* lib/url.c: When we re-use an existing connection we must make
	  sure that we don't accidentally re-use the connect_addr field, as
	  that might no longer be around. Fix verified by Tracy Boehrer who
	  basicly debugged and tracked down this problem.

2003-07-23 14:55  bagder

	* lib/hostip.c: minor code style fix

2003-07-23 13:59  bagder

	* CHANGES, CHANGES.2002: Split out the changes from the year 2002
	  into a separate file, named CHANGES.2002.

2003-07-23 13:39  bagder

	* Makefile.am, docs/Makefile.am: SSLCERTS was moved into the docs/
	  directory

2003-07-23 13:38  bagder

	* SSLCERTS, docs/SSLCERTS: moved SSLCERTS into the docs/ directory

2003-07-23 13:28  bagder

	* lib/http_negotiate.c: Daniel Kouril's fix to make the
	  GSS-Negotiate work fine.

2003-07-23 10:21  bagder

	* lib/Makefile.vc6, lib/curllib.dsp, src/Makefile.vc6,
	  src/urlglob.c: Juan F. Codagnone's fixes to build properly on
	  Windows again

2003-07-23 10:11  bagder

	* lib/ca-bundle.h: Plain default version of this file, to allow
	  users to build easier from CVS. This will be updated by the
	  configure script, and a default is placed here by the maketgz
	  script.

2003-07-22 13:15  bagder

	* lib/url.c: reversed the check for GSSAPI when request that auth

2003-07-22 12:00  bagder

	* lib/README.memoryleak: CURLDEBUG, not MALLOCDEBUG

2003-07-22 11:59  bagder

	* lib/http_ntlm.c: More support for NTLM on proxies, now proxy
	  state and nonce is stored in a separate struct properly.

2003-07-22 11:58  bagder

	* lib/: http_ntlm.h, transfer.c: The NTLM functions now take a
	  'proxy' argument as well.

2003-07-22 11:58  bagder

	* lib/urldata.h: Added a separate struct for the proxyntlm data, as
	  it will/can be different than the remote server's. That is, both
	  the server and the proxy can in fact require NTLM auth.

2003-07-22 11:57  bagder

	* tests/README: CURLDEBUG is the symbol now

2003-07-22 10:23  bagder

	* include/curl/curl.h: Don't depend on the TIME_WITH_SYS_TIME
	  define. win32 doesn't have sys/time.h and I don't think we need
	  it.

2003-07-21 15:16  bagder

	* lib/: http.c, http_ntlm.h, url.c, url.h, urldata.h: moved the
	  proxyuser and proxypasswd fields from the sessionhandle to the
	  connectdata to work as expected

2003-07-21 15:16  bagder

	* lib/http_ntlm.c: adjusted to support NTLM for proxies

2003-07-21 11:19  bagder

	* lib/: ftp.c, krb4.c: krb4-fixes for the moved user+password
	  fields within the structs

2003-07-21 10:25  bagder

	* include/curl/curl.h, src/version.h: pre4-commit

2003-07-21 10:25  bagder

	* CHANGES: pre4

2003-07-21 09:54  bagder

	* CHANGES: the CWD-null bug fix

2003-07-20 02:19  bagder

	* tests/data/test106: the fixed skip-blanks in the FTP CWD code
	  called for this adjustment

2003-07-20 02:18  bagder

	* lib/ftp.c: David Gardner pointed out in bug report 770755 that
	  using the FTP command CWD with a blank argument is a bad idea.
	  Now skip blanks.

2003-07-20 02:02  bagder

	* lib/url.c: If NTLM is requested, only re-use connections that
	  have the exact same credentials.

2003-07-20 01:58  bagder

	* CHANGES: explains my fixes just committed

2003-07-20 01:57  bagder

	* tests/data/: test10, test11, test13, test15, test16, test17,
	  test18, test2, test22, test26, test27, test28, test29, test301,
	  test304, test306, test31, test33, test39, test4, test40, test42,
	  test43, test44, test45, test46, test47, test49, test5, test50,
	  test502, test503, test51, test52, test53, test54, test55, test56,
	  test57, test58, test59, test6, test60, test61, test62, test63,
	  test64, test65, test66, test67, test68, test69, test7, test70,
	  test8, test9: modified to work fine with the new persistant
	  connection working test suite HTTP server

2003-07-20 01:56  bagder

	* tests/FILEFORMAT: swsclose added

2003-07-20 01:56  bagder

	* lib/: ftp.c, http.c, http_digest.c, http_ntlm.c, krb4.c, ldap.c,
	  telnet.c, url.c: Access the user and passwd fields from the
	  connectdata struct now instead of the sessionhandle struct, as
	  that was not good.

2003-07-20 01:55  bagder

	* lib/urldata.h: No longer stores user+password in the
	  sessionhandle, now doing that in the connectdata struct instead.
	  Each being an allocated pointer.

	  The passwdgiven field was turned into a local variable in the
	  only function it was being used.

2003-07-20 01:54  bagder

	* tests/server/sws.c: fixed the CONNECT thing again

2003-07-20 01:44  bagder

	* tests/server/sws.c: If the data contents contains the word
	  'swsclose', then this server will disconnect the client after the
	  response have been sent. This also happens if the respons is zero
	  byte long.

	  In all other cases (unless an error happens), it will now
	  maintain the connection to allow proper persistant connection
	  testing. This was required for the NTLM testing to work so I
	  finally had to fix this. Of course most of the existing HTTP
	  tests will be adjusted to work with this new rule of test file
	  syntax for HTTP tests.

	  Also fixed the log function to deal with varargs for better
	  logging.

2003-07-16 02:04  bagder

	* CHANGES: recent changes

2003-07-16 01:47  bagder

	* lib/: http_ntlm.c, urldata.h: Moved the NTLM credentials to the
	  connectdata struct instead, as NTLM authenticates connections and
	  not single requests. This should make it work better when we mix
	  requests from multiple hosts. Problem pointed out by Cris
	  Bailiff.

2003-07-16 01:06  bagder

	* lib/transfer.c: Fix to the endless loop of bad Basic
	  authentication as reported in Cris Bailiff's bug report 768275.

2003-07-16 00:58  bagder

	* lib/http_ntlm.c: Dan Winship's patch added that makes use of
	  DOMAIN\USER or DOMAIN/USER for the user field. I changed it
	  slightly to stay with strchr() only instead of strpbrk() for
	  portability reasons.

2003-07-16 00:46  bagder

	* lib/multi.c: Dan Winship's fix to make the new auth stuff such as
	  NTLM to work with the multi interface

2003-07-16 00:44  bagder

	* docs/libcurl/curl_easy_setopt.3: Dan Winship pointed out this
	  flaw

2003-07-05 15:27  bagder

	* lib/ssluse.c: re-use existing variable instead of declaring a new
	  local one

2003-07-05 15:13  bagder

	* lib/getpass.c, lib/setup.h, src/main.c, src/setup.h,
	  src/version.h: Some of Doug Kaufman's changes for the DOS port

2003-07-04 20:18  bagder

	* CHANGES: the latest changes

2003-07-04 20:17  bagder

	* src/config.h.in: HAVE_SETVBUF removed, no longer used

2003-07-04 20:15  bagder

	* lib/ca-bundle.h.in: removed

2003-07-04 20:15  bagder

	* configure.ac, lib/Makefile.am: Dan Grayson pointed out that we
	  set the CURL_CA_BUNDLE variable wrongly in the configure script.
	  We set it differently now and generate the lib/ca-bundle.h file
	  entirely.

2003-07-04 19:16  bagder

	* src/main.c: remove the usage of setvbuf() and use fflush()
	  instead if no buffering should be done on the output

2003-07-04 18:37  bagder

	* tests/libtest/first.c: CURLDEBUG not MALLOCDEBUG anymore

2003-07-04 18:36  bagder

	* tests/data/: test67, test68, test69: adjusted to the NTLM updates

2003-07-04 18:29  bagder

	* include/curl/curl.h, lib/http.c, lib/ssluse.c, lib/transfer.c,
	  lib/url.c, lib/urldata.h: Peter Sylvester's patch was applied
	  that introduces the following:

	     CURLOPT_SSL_CTX_FUNCTION to set a callback that gets called
	  with the
	     OpenSSL's ssl_ctx pointer passed in and allow a callback to
	  act on it. If
	     anything but CURLE_OK is returned, that will also be returned
	  by libcurl
	     all the way back. If this function changes the CURLOPT_URL,
	  libcurl will
	     detect this and instead go use the new URL.

	     CURLOPT_SSL_CTX_DATA is a pointer you set to get passed to the
	  callback set
	     with CURLOPT_SSL_CTX_FUNCTION.

2003-07-01 17:21  bagder

	* tests/server/sws.c: David Byron's patch that allows a client to
	  make the server quit with a magic url.

2003-07-01 14:12  bagder

	* README: new CVS info

2003-07-01 12:12  bagder

	* lib/ldap.c: Gisle Vanem found a lib handle leak in the ldap code

2003-06-27 16:37  bagder

	* Makefile.am: When I introduced the DIST_SUBDIRS usage, I broken
	  the 'make install' for include files and docs, so now I've added
	  a custom install hook to run make install for docs and install
	  when data is installed at the top-level.

2003-06-26 23:30  sterling

	* SSLCERTS: revert out my bogus commit. ;-)

2003-06-26 23:17  sterling

2003-06-26 13:26  bagder

	* lib/http_ntlm.c: Many fixes, most of them based on comments by
	  Eric Glass

2003-06-26 13:25  bagder

	  continue without any Authorization: headers as long as our
	  connection is maintained.

2003-06-13 11:09  bagder

	* tests/runtests.pl: stdout is good enough

2003-06-13 11:04  bagder

	* tests/runtests.pl: work more on pids, less on pidfiles to be able
	  to do better kills at the end of the test where the pidfiles
	  aren't found, but "our" server is running

2003-06-13 10:03  bagder

	* tests/data/: Makefile.am, test67, test68: fixed NTLM test 67,

2003-06-13 09:14  bagder

	* lib/http_ntlm.c: use more curlish strings, these should be able
	  to change...

2003-06-13 08:48  bagder

	* lib/: multi.c, share.c: Marty Kuhrt's #include fixes for VMS

2003-06-13 01:05  bagder

2003-06-12 19:34  bagder

	* lib/http.c, lib/transfer.c, lib/url.c, include/curl/curl.h,
	  lib/urldata.h: CURLHTTP* renamed to CURLAUTH* and NEGOTIATE is
	  now GSSNEGOTIATE as there's a "plain" Negotiate as well.

2003-06-12 18:39  bagder

	* tests/data/: Makefile.am, test67: NTLM test case

2003-06-12 18:38  bagder

	* tests/: FILEFORMAT, runtests.pl, data/test130, data/test131,
	  data/test132, data/test133, data/test134: require the netrc_debug
	  feature the same way we now can require SSL present client-side

2003-06-12 18:22  bagder

	* tests/: runtests.pl, FILEFORMAT: now test cases can be set to be
	  dependent on the presence of "SSL" in the client/library

2003-06-12 15:55  bagder

	* lib/http_ntlm.c: make it build with older OpenSSL

2003-06-12 15:18  bagder

	* lib/http_ntlm.c: attempt to make older OpenSSL versions work with
	  the DES stuff

2003-06-12 14:54  bagder

	* src/: Makefile.am, mkhelp.pl: Based on Dan Fandrich's patch and
	  gzip unpack function, we now compress the 'hugehelp' text if libz
	  and gzip are available at build time.

2003-06-12 14:53  bagder

	* configure.ac: store HAVE_LIBZ as an automake conditional

2003-06-11 18:14  bagder

	* lib/: http_ntlm.c, transfer.c: fixing details for NTLM

2003-06-11 17:33  bagder

	* lib/http_ntlm.c: more how I envision it _should_ work, but it
	  still doesn't...

2003-06-11 17:31  bagder

	* lib/urldata.h: to support "redirects" after the full body is
	  transfered

2003-06-11 17:31  bagder

	* lib/base64.c: made a nicer output for the decode test, as it
	  served as a nice tool for me ;-)

2003-06-11 17:30  bagder

	* lib/transfer.c: when we get the auth headers, we still need to
	  read out the full body response as otherwise we can re-send
	  requests on the same connection nicely

2003-06-11 16:05  bagder

	* lib/http_ntlm.c: correct mistakes

2003-06-11 15:44  bagder

	* tests/FILEFORMAT: describe the NTLM mechanism too

2003-06-11 15:44  bagder

2003-06-11 15:38  bagder

	* lib/: Makefile.am, base64.c, http.c, http_ntlm.c, http_ntlm.h,
	  transfer.c, url.c, urldata.h: Initial take at NTLM
	  authentication. It doesn't really work at this point but the
	  infrastructure is there.

2003-06-10 15:06  bagder

	* docs/libcurl/curl_easy_setopt.3: clarify the CUSTOMREQUEST and
	  HTTPHEADER options slightly

2003-06-10 14:58  bagder

	* docs/libcurl/curl_easy_setopt.3: CURLOPT_HTTPAUTH docu

2003-06-10 14:49  bagder

	* CHANGES, include/curl/curl.h, lib/url.c, lib/urldata.h,
	  src/main.c: Set auth type differently, we use one
	  CURLOPT_HTTPAUTH instead as we plan to add more method in the
	  future.

2003-06-10 14:25  bagder

	* docs/THANKS: Daniel Kouril for the HTTP negotiate stuff

2003-06-10 14:22  bagder

	* CHANGES, configure.ac, docs/curl.1,
	  docs/libcurl/curl_easy_setopt.3, include/curl/curl.h,
	  lib/Makefile.am, lib/http.c, lib/http_negotiate.c,
	  lib/http_negotiate.h, lib/transfer.c, lib/url.c, lib/urldata.h,
	  src/main.c, src/version.h: Daniel Kouril's patch that adds HTTP
	  negotiation support to libcurl was added.

2003-06-10 14:07  bagder

	* CHANGES: we fix more

2003-06-10 14:05  bagder

	* tests/libtest/Makefile.am: more generic

2003-06-10 11:42  bagder

	* src/: main.c, urlglob.c, urlglob.h: Pass the error stream pointer
	  to the URL globber, so that it can report errors correctly to the
	  user, if need be.

	  Also fixed so that a missing ] in the globbing process no longer
	  leads to core dump.

2003-06-06 16:58  bagder

	* lib/http.c: When doing very big GET requests over HTTPS, we need
	  to add some extra funky logic in order to make re-tries work fine
	  with OpenSSL. This corrects the problem David Orrell noticed.

2003-06-06 16:56  bagder

	* lib/sendf.c: Just moved around some logic in Curl_write() to make
	  it easier to debug.

2003-06-06 08:44  bagder

	* include/README: spellfix

2003-06-05 16:04  bagder

	* include/curl/multi.h: Reversed the logic to only include the
	  <sys/select.h> header on systems known to really NEED it as
	  another system that doesn't have it came up: very old Linux
	  libc5-based systems (as addition to all HPUX versions).

	  The only known system at this point is AIX.

2003-06-03 10:10  bagder

	* docs/KNOWN_BUGS: LDAP problem added as mention in bug report
	  #735752

2003-06-03 10:07  bagder

	* src/main.c: include the time headers just like we used to do in
	  the curl/curl.h header once upon the time

2003-06-03 10:06  bagder

	* src/config.h.in: we want the time defines too

2003-06-03 09:53  bagder

	* tests/data/test3: Content-Length: now overrides other means of
	  knowing when the stream has ended.

2003-06-02 16:57  bagder

	* lib/transfer.c: Make the Content-Length info override the
	  Connection: close header, so that libcurl will stop reading when
	  the number of bytes have arrived and not wait for a closed
	  socket.

2003-06-02 16:48  bagder

	* tests/README: the 500-599 test case range

2003-06-02 15:55  bagder

	* .cvsignore: ignore more

2003-06-02 15:53  bagder

	* packages/DOS/.cvsignore: ignore

2003-06-02 15:42  bagder

	* src/main.c: David Byron's fix to get the progress-bar use the
	  local size too when doing a resumed download.

2003-06-02 15:31  bagder

	* CHANGES: makefile fiddle changed how http requests are sent - now
	  in one chunk more often HPUX include fix in the external headers
	  better SSL work-arounds for bad SSL servers modified error
	  message when CURLE_HTTP_RETURNED_ERROR is returned

2003-06-02 15:27  bagder

	* lib/ssluse.c: work-around SSL implementation flaws better,
	  pointed out in bug report #745122.

2003-06-02 15:14  bagder

	* lib/transfer.c: make a more descriptive error message when
	  CURLE_HTTP_RETURNED_ERROR is returned

2003-05-28 12:24  bagder

	* docs/FEATURES: haven't updates this in a loooong time

2003-05-28 09:54  bagder

	* lib/http.c: Posting static data using POST and chunked encoded
	  now also appends the data to the initial request buffer, if the
	  total post data is less than 100K.

2003-05-28 00:56  bagder

	* src/main.c: include sys/time.h, we didn't have a time() proto
	  anymore. Did one of the changes in curl/curl.h make this occur?

2003-05-27 14:51  bagder

	* include/README: Documented which rules the public headers must
	  follow when we write preprocessor checks for condititions.

2003-05-27 14:51  bagder

	* include/curl/curl.h: oops, removed a # too many

2003-05-27 14:45  bagder

	* include/curl/: curl.h, stdcheaders.h: remove usage of HAVE_*
	  defines, we cannot and shall not depend on any such defines in
	  the public external header files

2003-05-27 14:34  bagder

	* include/curl/multi.h: sys/select.h is not present on HPUX, avoid
	  including it

2003-05-27 14:18  bagder

	* testcurl.sh: made it work ;-)

2003-05-27 14:03  bagder

	* testcurl.sh: if cvs update fails, attempt again after 5 seconds
	  and retry 50 times before giving up

2003-05-27 10:51  bagder

	* Makefile.am: Only build in lib and src by default, make the
	  others dist-subdirs.	Make the test stuff get built when we run
	  'make test' instead.

2003-05-27 10:33  bagder

	* lib/http.c: Rudy Koento experienced problems with curl's recent
	  habit of POSTing data in two separate send() calls, first the
	  headers and then the data. I've now made a fix that for static
	  and known content that isn't to be chunked-encoded, everything is
	  now sent in one single system call again. This is also better for
	  network performance reasons.

2003-05-27 09:37  bagder

	* docs/INSTALL: runs on DOS now

2003-05-27 08:41  bagder

	* CHANGES: include file flaw and yet another socks5-fix

2003-05-27 08:28  bagder

	* lib/http.c: Another socks5-fix. Make sure that when we use a
	  socks-proxy, it is not the same as using a httpproxy so we must
	  make sure to better check for http proxies before we do HTTP
	  proxy stuff. This included authorization and URI usage in the
	  request etc.

2003-05-27 08:25  bagder

	* include/curl/curl.h: CURLOPT_HTTPDIGEST is added

2003-05-26 14:32  bagder

	* include/curl/multi.h: language

2003-05-26 10:19  bagder

	* docs/TODO: ftp ASCII transfers in general need fixing

2003-05-26 09:57  bagder

	* include/curl/multi.h: Chris Lewis mentioned that he doesn't get
	  WIN32 defined, only _WIN32 so we make an adjustment to catch
	  this.

2003-05-23 13:24  bagder

	* CHANGES: even more

2003-05-23 13:14  bagder

	* lib/ftp.c: Ricardo Cadime found a socket leak when listing
	  directories without contents. Test cases 144 and 145 were added
	  to verify the fix.

	  Now we deal with return code 450 properly and other codes also do
	  proper cleanup.

2003-05-23 13:10  bagder

	* tests/data/: Makefile.am, test144, test145: more ftp testing
	  using NLST and no contents and bad return code

2003-05-23 11:47  bagder

	* lib/transfer.c: Rudy Koento's problem fixed, test case 66
	  verifies this.

2003-05-23 11:46  bagder

	* tests/data/: Makefile.am, test66: test 66 returns one line of
	  data with no header (HTTP)

2003-05-23 10:06  bagder

	* docs/curl.1: --digest added, --compressed rephrased

2003-05-23 08:44  bagder

	* lib/url.c: include digest.h for proto

2003-05-23 08:43  bagder

	* lib/if2ip.c: DJGPP fix by Gisle Vanem

2003-05-23 00:47  bagder

	* CHANGES: more more more

2003-05-23 00:45  bagder

	* lib/http.c: warning-free is better

2003-05-23 00:40  bagder

	* src/main.c: Introducing --digest

2003-05-23 00:39  bagder

	* lib/http_digest.c: hush the compiler

2003-05-22 18:09  bagder

	* lib/: Makefile.am, http.c, http_digest.c, http_digest.h, md5.c,
	  md5.h, transfer.c, urldata.h: Initial Digest support. At least
	  partly working.

2003-05-21 17:53  bagder

	* lib/escape.c: David Balazic pointed out the lack of checks for a
	  valid %XX code when we unescape a string. We now check and decode
	  only valid %XX strings.

2003-05-21 10:12  bagder

	* configure.ac: fix the makefile in packages/DOS too

2003-05-21 10:08  bagder

	* CHANGES, Makefile.dist, docs/examples/Makefile.am,
	  docs/examples/makefile.dj, lib/Makefile.am, lib/config.dj,
	  lib/getpass.c, lib/makefile.dj, lib/setup.h, lib/url.c,
	  lib/urldata.h, packages/Makefile.am, packages/DOS/Makefile.am,
	  packages/DOS/README, packages/DOS/common.dj, src/Makefile.am,
	  src/main.c, src/makefile.dj, src/setup.h:  Gisle Vanem made curl
	  build with djgpp on DOS.

2003-05-21 09:21  bagder

2003-05-20 11:41  bagder

	* lib/hostip.c: Gisle Vanem's code for not trusting h_aliases to
	  always be non-NULL

2003-05-20 08:33  bagder

	* maketgz: Remind about the gpg command lines

2003-05-19 15:14  bagder

	* CHANGES: support user name and password in proxy environment
	  variables

2003-05-16 12:57  bagder

	* docs/KNOWN_BUGS: known AIX ipv6 problems

2003-05-16 00:28  bagder

	* lib/cookie.c: Skip any preceeding dots from the domain name of
	  cookies when we keep them in memory, only add it when we save the
	  cookie. This makes all tailmatching and domain string matching
	  internally a lot easier.

	  This was also the reason for a remaining bug I introduced in my
	  overhaul.

2003-05-15 23:13  bagder

	* acinclude.m4: change the order of the in_addr_t tests, so that
	  'unsigned long' is tested for first, as it seems to be what many
	  systems use

2003-05-15 10:13  bagder

2003-05-13 14:12  bagder

	* lib/: connect.c, hostip.c, hostip.h: Setup and use
	  CURL_INADDR_NONE all over instead of INADDR_NONE. We setup the
	  define accordingly in the hostip.h header to work nicely all
	  over.

2003-05-13 14:11  bagder

	* lib/ftp.c: before using if2ip(), check if the address is an ip
	  address and skip it if it is.

2003-05-13 11:38  bagder

	* CVS-INFO: libtool 1.4.2 is enough

2003-05-13 11:37  bagder

	* buildconf: fix comment

2003-05-12 15:06  bagder

	* lib/connect.c: before checking for network interfaces using
	  if2ip(), check that the given name isn't an ip address

2003-05-12 15:05  bagder

	* buildconf: no more complaining when I have 1.5 and it tests for
	  1.4.2

2003-05-12 14:49  bagder

	* CHANGES: fixes from the last week+

2003-05-12 14:47  bagder

	  CURLOPT_ENCODING description after his changes to allow "" to
	  enable all support formats.

2003-05-12 14:46  bagder

	* docs/curl.1: Dan Fandrich added --compressed docu

2003-05-12 14:45  bagder

	* src/main.c: setting ENCODING to "" means enable-all-you-support

2003-05-12 14:45  bagder

	* lib/: README.encoding, content_encoding.h, transfer.c, url.c:
	  Dan Fandrich changed CURLOPT_ENCODING to select all supported
	  encodings if
	   set to "".  This frees the application from having to know which
	  encodings
	   the library supports.

2003-05-12 14:38  bagder

	* buildconf: Dan Fandrich lowered the libtool requirement

2003-05-12 14:37  bagder

2003-05-12 14:29  bagder

	* lib/http.c: incoming proxy headers shall be sent to the debug
	  function has HEADERs not DATA

2003-05-09 10:17  bagder

	* buildconf: oops, run libtoolize as the first tool

2003-05-09 10:13  bagder

	* buildconf: run libtoolize too

2003-05-09 10:12  bagder

	* include/curl/multi.h: AIX wants sys/select.h

2003-05-09 09:07  bagder

	* docs/FAQ: clarify on the curl name issue and that there may be
	  other libcurl-based tools that provide GUI

2003-05-06 10:19  bagder

	* lib/sendf.c:	Kevin Delafield reported another case where we
	  didn't correctly check for
	   EAGAIN but only EWOULDBLOCK, which caused badness on HPUX. We
	  also check for
	   and act the same on EINTR errors as well now.

2003-05-05 16:19  bagder

	* CVS-INFO: fixed the required tools' version numbers

2003-05-04 18:07  bagder

	* buildconf: put back the libtool test, now for 1.5 require
	  autoconf 2.57 require automake 1.7

2003-05-02 11:13  bagder

	* lib/http.c: If there is a custom Host: header specified, we use
	  that host name to extract the correct set of cookies to send.
	  This functionality is verified by test case 62.

2003-05-02 11:12  bagder

	* tests/data/: Makefile.am, test62: send correct cookies when using
	  a custom Host:

2003-05-02 11:11  bagder

	  plain errno, for better portability. Also use Andy Cedilnik's
	  compiler warning fixes.

2003-04-30 22:29  bagder

	* tests/README: the test numbers are now only for human
	  readability, the numbers no longer enforces protocol/server

2003-04-30 22:28  bagder

	* tests/runtests.pl: no longer assume that the test number implies
	  servers to run

2003-04-30 22:25  bagder

	  test53, test54, test55, test56, test57, test58, test59, test6,
	  test60, test61, test7, test8, test9: Each test case now specifies
	  which server(s) it needs, without relying on the test number.

2003-04-30 22:08  bagder

	* tests/data/Makefile.am: we say welcome to test 142

2003-04-30 22:07  bagder

	* tests/data/test142: verify that curl fails fine when an FTP URL
	  with a too deep dir hierarchy is used

2003-04-30 22:04  bagder

	* lib/ftp.c: when making up the list of path parts, save the last
	  entry pointing to NULL as otherwise we'll go nuts

2003-04-30 22:01  bagder

	* CHANGES: recent action

2003-04-30 21:58  bagder

	* lib/url.c: if there's a cookiehost allocated, free that too

2003-04-30 21:56  bagder

	* tests/data/test61: ok, make the test run ok too

2003-04-30 21:49  bagder

	* tests/data/: Makefile.am, test61: various new cookie tests with a
	  custom Host: header set

2003-04-30 19:16  bagder

	* tests/data/: test103, test104, test106, test108, test125,
	  test126, test127, test137, test138, test190, test31, test401:
	  modified to work with modified code

2003-04-30 19:15  bagder

	* tests/runtests.pl: modified to produce nicer output when a single
	  test fails

2003-04-30 19:15  bagder

	* tests/getpart.pm: make the diffs with 'diff -u' to make them
	  nicer and easier to read

2003-04-30 19:12  bagder

	* lib/http.c: stop parsing Host: host names at colons too

2003-04-30 19:05  bagder

	* lib/transfer.c: modified to the new cookie function proto

2003-04-30 19:04  bagder

	* lib/http.c: extract host name from custom Host: headers to use
	  for cookies

2003-04-30 19:03  bagder

	* lib/: cookie.c, cookie.h: Many cookie fixes:	 o Save domains in
	  jars like Mozilla does. It means all domains set in
	  Set-Cookie: headers are dot-prefixed.    o Save and use the
	  'tailmatch' field in the Mozilla/Netscape cookie jars (the
	  second column).    o Reject cookies using illegal domains in the
	  Set-Cookie: line. Concerns	  both domains with too few dots or
	  domains that are outside the currently      operating server
	  host's domain.    o Set the path part by default to the one used
	  in the request, if none was	   set in the Set-Cookie line.

2003-04-30 19:01  bagder

	* lib/urldata.h: changes need for the new ftp path treatment and
	  the new cookie code

2003-04-30 18:59  bagder

	* lib/ftp.c: David Balazic's patch to make the FTP operations "do
	  right" according to RFC1738, which means it'll use one CWD for
	  each pathpart.

2003-04-30 09:32  bagder

	* docs/INSTALL: two more platforms Rich Gray built curl on

2003-04-29 20:03  bagder

	* lib/multi.c:	Peter Kovacs provided a patch that makes the
	  CURLINFO_CONNECT_TIME work fine
	   when using the multi interface (too).

2003-04-29 18:55  bagder

	* docs/INSTALL: mention configure --help

2003-04-28 19:29  bagder

	* docs/TODO: CURLOPT_FTPPORT could support port number too

	* perl/contrib/formfind: corrected the comment which wasn't correct

2003-04-25 17:08  bagder

	* lib/Makefile.vc6: RSAglue.lib is no longer needed with recent
	  OpenSSL versions

2003-04-24 08:34  bagder

	* src/main.c: Dan Fandrich added support for the gzip
	  Content-Encoding for --compressed

2003-04-23 14:09  bagder

	* tests/data/: Makefile.am, test60: Bryan Kemp's reported problems
	  with curl and PUT from stdin and a faked content-length made me
	  add test case 60, that does exactly this, but it seems to run
	  fine...

2003-04-23 01:30  bagder

	* CHANGES: last 10 days or so

2003-04-23 01:29  bagder

	* config.guess, config.sub, ltmain.sh: libtool 1.5 stuff

	* buildconf: stop checking for libtool, we don't run that in this
	  script

2003-04-23 00:33  bagder

	* lib/: http_chunks.c, transfer.c: Dan Fandrich corrected the error
	  messages on "bad encoding".

2003-04-23 00:32  bagder

	* lib/content_encoding.c: Dan Fandrich's gzip bugfix

2003-04-23 00:31  bagder

	* buildconf: Dan Fandrich's fix

2003-04-22 23:42  bagder

	* lib/easy.c:  Peter Sylvester pointed out that curl_easy_setopt()
	  will always (wrongly)
	   return CURLE_OK no matter what happens.

2003-04-16 14:46  bagder

	* docs/curl.1: two dashes is enough

2003-04-15 16:18  bagder

	* tests/libtest/lib505.c: typecast the setting of the size, as it
	  might be an off_t which is bigger than long and libcurl expects a
	  long...

2003-04-15 16:01  bagder

	* src/setup.h: If MALLOCDEBUG, include the lib's setup.h here so
	  that the proper defines are set before all system headers, as
	  otherwise we get compiler warnings on my Solaris at least.

2003-04-15 15:32  bagder

	* tests/libtest/test.h: include config.h before all system headers,
	  so that _FILE_OFFSET_BITS and similar is set properly by us first

	* docs/curl.1: extended the -F section

2003-04-15 11:29  bagder

	* lib/formdata.c: treat uploaded .html files as text/html by
	  default

2003-04-15 00:00  bagder

	* lib/ssluse.c: return the same error for the sslv2 "certificate
	  verify failed" code

2003-04-14 16:54  bagder

	* src/main.c: new wording by Kevin Roth

2003-04-14 15:09  bagder

	* src/.cvsignore: ignore all stamp-h*

2003-04-14 15:09  bagder

	* src/main.c: With the recent fix of libcurl, it shall now return
	  CURLE_SSL_CACERT when it had problems withe CA cert and thus we
	  offer a huge blurb of verbose help to explain to the poor user
	  why this happens.

2003-04-14 14:53  bagder

	* lib/ssluse.c: Restored the SSL error codes since they was broken
	  in the 7.10.4 release, also now attempt to detect and return the
	  specific CACERT error code.

2003-04-14 09:13  bagder

	* CHANGES: FTP CWD response fixed gzip content-encoding added
	  chunked content-encoding fixed

2003-04-11 18:31  bagder

	  must not be called with 0 lenth data.

	  I edited somewhat and removed trailing whitespaces.

2003-04-11 18:23  bagder

	* lib/http_chunks.c: Nic Hines fixed this bug when deflate or gzip
	  contents were downloaded using chunked encoding.

2003-04-11 18:23  bagder

	* lib/url.c: ah, move the zero byte too or havoc will occur

2003-04-11 18:22  bagder

	* tests/data/: Makefile.am, test59: verify the new url parser fix

2003-04-11 18:08  bagder

	* lib/url.c: support ? as separator instead of / even if not
	  protocol was given

2003-04-11 10:57  bagder

	* docs/THANKS: these guys deserve a mentioning here as well

2003-04-11 10:55  bagder

	  applied

2003-04-11 10:19  bagder

	* docs/: curl.1, libcurl/curl_easy_setopt.3: when saving a cookie
	  jar fails, you don't get an error code or anything, just a
	  warning in the verbose output stream

2003-04-11 10:10  bagder

	* lib/ftp.c:  According to RFC959, CWD is supposed to return 250 on
	  success, but
	   there seem to be non-compliant FTP servers out there that return
	  200,
	   so we accept any '2xy' response now.

2003-04-11 09:39  bagder

	* lib/url.c: show a verbose warning message in case cookie-saving
	  fails, after Ralph Mitchell's notification.

2003-04-10 13:43  bagder

	* tests/data/: test139, test140, test141: new ftp tests

	* lib/url.c: Vlad Krupin's URL parsing patch to fix the URL parsing
	  when the URL has no slash after the host name, but still a ? and

	* tests/ftpserver.pl: oops, committed test code not meant to be
	  here

2003-04-09 13:57  bagder

	* lib/sendf.c: the default debugfunction shows incoming headers as
	  well

2003-04-09 13:56  bagder

	  header look correct using GMT always

	* tests/data/: test304, test39, test44, test9: adjusted the
	  formpost testcases to the new boundary string construction

2003-04-04 14:24  bagder

	* lib/formdata.c: Changed how boundary strings are generated. This
	  new way uses 28 dashes and 12 following hexadecimal letters,
	  which seems to be what IE uses.  This makes curl work smoother
	  with more stupidly written server apps.

	  Worked this out together with Martijn Broenland.

2003-04-03 18:11  bagder

	* lib/hostip.c: spell fix

2003-04-03 16:16  bagder

	* lib/ftp.c: kill a compiler warning on cygwin

2003-04-03 15:43  bagder

	* tests/server/sws.c: Added log output for when the writing of the
	  input HTTP request is successful or unsuccessful. Used to track
	  down the recent cygwin test suite problems.

2003-04-03 15:42  bagder

	* tests/ftpserver.pl: Modified how we log data to server.input, as
	  we can't keep the file open very much as it makes it troublesome
	  on certain operating systems.

2003-04-03 15:39  bagder

	* tests/data/test505: new

2003-04-02 09:48  bagder

	* include/curl/curl.h, src/version.h: 7.10.4 commit

2003-04-02 09:42  bagder

	* CHANGES: Version 7.10.4

2003-04-01 10:43  bagder

	* tests/FILEFORMAT: documented the new killserver tag

2003-04-01 10:42  bagder

	* tests/data/test402: kill the ftp server afterwards, it is just so
	  messed up

2003-04-01 10:42  bagder

	* tests/ftpserver.pl: log when we've returned verification that we
	  are the test server

2003-04-01 10:41  bagder

	* tests/runtests.pl: support the new <killserver> tag

2003-04-01 09:13  bagder

	* tests/libtest/.cvsignore: ignore lib505 too

2003-04-01 09:13  bagder

	* tests/libtest/: Makefile.am, lib505.c: lib505.c is a new test
	  case for ftp uploading with rename

2003-04-01 09:10  bagder

	* tests/ftpserver.pl: Added support for the RNFR/RNTO commands

2003-04-01 00:16  bagder

	* README: updated

2003-03-31 23:43  bagder

	* lib/url.c: move the ssl config clone call to before the
	  connectionexists call and then also subsequently free the ssl
	  struct if the connection struct is to be deleted

2003-03-31 17:59  bumblebury

	* lib/cookie.c: testing, ignore this commit

2003-03-31 16:02  bagder

	* CHANGES, include/curl/curl.h, src/version.h: 7.10.4-pre6 commit

2003-03-31 13:37  bagder

	* Makefile.am: added dist-hook that clears the tests/log dir
	  properly as otherwise 'make distcheck' doesn't pass

2003-03-31 07:13  bagder

	* lib/: ssluse.c, url.c, url.h, urldata.h: Fixup after talks with
	  Richard Bramante. We should now make better comparisons before
	  re-using SSL connections and re-using SSL connection IDs.

2003-03-31 06:42  bagder

	* src/main.c: --location-trusted added, which does a normal
	  location plus the new CURLOPT_UNRESTRICTED_AUTH option set TRUE.

	  Patch by Guillaume Cottenceau.

2003-03-31 06:41  bagder

	* docs/libcurl/curl_easy_setopt.3, lib/http.c, include/curl/curl.h,
	  lib/url.c, lib/urldata.h: Guillaume Cottenceau's patch that adds
	  CURLOPT_UNRESTRICTED_AUTH that disables the host name check in
	  the FOLLOWLOCATION code. With that option set, libcurl will send
	  user+password to all hosts.

2003-03-31 06:05  bagder

	* CHANGES: 10 days of fixes

2003-03-31 06:04  bagder

	* docs/libcurl/curl_easy_setopt.3: clarify USERPWD somewhat more

2003-03-31 05:42  bagder

	* lib/url.c: Frankie Fong filed bug report #708708 which identified
	  a problem with ConnectionExists() when first doing a proxy
	  connecto to a HTTPS site and then switching over to a HTTP
	  connection to the same host.

	  This fix corrects the problem.

2003-03-29 12:03  bagder

	* src/main.c: Dan Shearer's fix from bug report #618892, which
	  makes 'curl -O' output an error message about a missing URL.

2003-03-28 13:56  bagder

	* docs/TODO: send as much as possible of the POST at once

2003-03-27 16:09  bagder

	* README: added section titles and a CONTACT paragraph asking
	  people to use the mailing lists

2003-03-26 20:05  bagder

	* configure.ac: fixed the pkg-config stuff for rh9

2003-03-26 12:48  bagder

	* docs/CONTRIBUTE: add URLs to patch and diff

2003-03-26 12:44  bagder

	* docs/BUGS: mention the URL to the mailing lists

2003-03-25 23:40  bagder

	* configure.ac: attempt to extract openssl information using
	  pkg-config

2003-03-25 16:56  bagder

	* configure.ac, configure.in: Renamed configure.in to configure.ac,
	  as this is the supposedly new preferred name for it.

2003-03-25 16:54  bagder

	* configure.in: use init and copyright to get a better header in
	  the generated script

2003-03-25 15:23  bagder

	* lib/url.c: white space and indent fix

2003-03-25 00:11  bagder

	* lib/.cvsignore: ignore getdate.c

2003-03-25 00:10  bagder

	* lib/: url.c, urldata.h: Richard Bramante's provided a fix for a
	  handle re-use problem seen when you change options on an
	  SSL-enabled connection between requests.

2003-03-24 12:06  bagder

	* lib/ca-bundle.crt: Removed the "TC TrustCenter, Germany, Class 0
	  CA." certificate:

	  "It is a DEMO certificate and was never intended to be in any
	  list of trusted CA certificates."

	  (quote by Gtz Babin-Ebell, trustcenter.de)

2003-03-24 11:47  bagder

	* CHANGES: all those changes

2003-03-21 09:09  bagder

	* lib/url.c: Hopefully this change addresses these two bug reports:
	  707003 and 706624.

	  We need to make sure that when we init a 'connectdata' struct and
	  then afterwards check for and re-use another one, we must be
	  careful so that the newly set values are transmitted and used in
	  the surviving connectdata struct.

2003-03-20 16:12  bagder

	* CVS-INFO: lib/getdate.c.cvs may need a rename if you don't have
	  yacc or bison

2003-03-20 15:38  bagder

	* testcurl.sh: if the cvs update fails, don't continue further

2003-03-19 22:28  bagder

	* lib/urldata.h: make the ENGINE depend on the USE_SSLEAY define
	  too

2003-03-19 10:26  bagder

	* tests/: getpart.pm, runtests.pl: set binary mode for some file
	  handling and it might work better on some cygwin installations
	  (using DOS-style files somehow?)

2003-03-19 10:16  bagder

	* lib/hostip.c: typecast the conversion from const char * to char *

2003-03-19 10:09  bagder

	* lib/: getdate.c.cvs, getdate.c: Rename getdate.c to
	  getdate.c.cvs, since the "normal" build procedure do imply that
	  yacc/bison exists and can generate this file. Those without one
	  of those tools can then checkout and rename the getdate.c.cvs
	  file.

2003-03-18 11:01  bagder

	* docs/curl.1: clarify that 22 can be returned on --fail for all
	  HTTP errors being 400 or above

2003-03-17 18:20  bagder

	* tests/libtest/lib504.c: more defensive checking as platforms
	  differ...

2003-03-17 13:38  bagder

	* docs/examples/: ftpupload.c, sepheaders.c: Andy Cedilnik's
	  corrections

2003-03-16 19:41  bagder

	* CHANGES: it just never ends

2003-03-16 17:20  bagder

	* lib/getdate.c: regenerated from getdate.y

2003-03-16 17:15  bagder

	* lib/http.c: Juan F. Codagnone pointed out a missing thing from
	  the march 2 fix

2003-03-16 11:46  bagder

	* tests/server/sws.c: typecase getpid() to int to prevent compiler
	  warning

2003-03-15 22:04  bagder

	* configure.in: figure out select()'s argument types

2003-03-15 22:02  bagder

	* lib/memdebug.h: Gisle Vanem's fix to get this working nicely on
	  windows

2003-03-15 22:00  bagder

	* lib/getdate.y: Gisle Vanem fixed a name collision with structure
	  '"CONTEXT" in <winnt.h>

2003-03-15 18:26  bagder

	* tests/runtests.pl: missing newline added

2003-03-15 18:12  bagder

	* tests/data/test504: no server needed

2003-03-15 18:11  bagder

	* tests/runtests.pl: allow 'none' as server

2003-03-15 17:51  bagder

	* lib/urldata.h: Sort out the ENGINE problems people seem to be
	  having. Now we put all ENGINE related stuff within
	  HAVE_OPENSSL_ENGINE_H and we don't make any private typedef or
	  similar if the header is missing...

2003-03-15 17:43  bagder

	* tests/runtests.pl: * use the pid returned back from test-servers
	  and kill them before starting   them the first time * verify that
	  the server we start really comes up fine and works as   expected
	  before continue * count test cases where the server can't be run
	  (for whatever reason) * prefix lots of messages with RUN: to make
	  it easier to realize which script   is saying what when running
	  tests verbose * remove the generic sleep(1) from each test, makes
	  the suite fly! ;-)

	  I hope these changes will make the tests run somewhat more
	  reliably on more platforms.

2003-03-15 17:39  bagder

	* tests/: ftpserver.pl, server/sws.c: report pid back in the WE
	  ROOLZ message

2003-03-15 17:05  bagder

	* tests/server/sws.c: removed the "banner" when the server is
	  starting

2003-03-15 16:08  bagder

	* docs/TODO: detect lack of perl before running tests

2003-03-15 15:47  bagder

	* tests/server/sws.c: Rick Jones' minor thing to build better on
	  HPUX 11

2003-03-14 18:21  bagder

	* lib/config-vms.h: Nico Baggus little adjustment to build with
	  OpenSSL 0.9.7 (the ENGINE thing)

2003-03-14 13:44  bagder

	* configure.in: improved "deeper" check

2003-03-14 00:02  bagder

	* configure.in: No longer halts operation if select or socket are
	  missing, since in most cases this is wrong... and if they're
	  truly missing, we won't succeed to link later on anyway.

2003-03-13 22:41  bagder

	* lib/: multi.c, ssluse.c: Philippe Raoult needed this to build on
	  FreeBSD

2003-03-13 18:06  bagder

	* configure.in: Extra function-find magic for platforms that don't
	  like the way the default AC_CHECK_FUNCS() work. HPUX 11 is one of
	  them.

2003-03-13 16:56  bagder

	* testcurl.sh: output what cvs returned, see if we can make the
	  script bail out when cvs update fails

2003-03-13 16:54  bagder

	* tests/libtest/Makefile.am: use include path from BUILD dir since
	  we want the config.h

2003-03-12 15:29  bagder

	* CHANGES: Things are moving along...

2003-03-12 15:20  bagder

	* src/main.c: When we append stuff to the URL, we must make sure
	  the text is properly URL encoded before. Test case 58 added to
	  verify this.

2003-03-12 15:14  bagder

	* docs/KNOWN_BUGS: -m on curl on windows with telnet doesn't work

2003-03-12 15:04  bagder

	* tests/data/test58: This verifies that my fix for bug report
	  #700275 works.

2003-03-12 15:03  bagder

	* tests/data/Makefile.am: test58 added

2003-03-12 14:42  bagder

	* configure.in: improved the header checks --enable-libgcc check
	  for a sed before using it

2003-03-12 09:54  bagder

	* tests/libtest/: lib503.c, lib504.c: Add include files to prevent
	  warnings on some (HPUX) systems.

2003-03-12 09:54  bagder

	* tests/libtest/test.h: include "config.h" from the lib's private
	  dir

2003-03-12 09:53  bagder

	* tests/libtest/Makefile.am: Setup include path to the lib dir to
	  enable inclusion of "config.h"

2003-03-12 09:44  bagder

	* lib/telnet.c: Made set_local_option() properly static as reported
	  by Rick Jones

2003-03-12 09:40  bagder

	* lib/: arpa_telnet.h, telnet.c: Prefix defines and symbols with
	  CURL_ to reduce the risk of colliding with various system's other
	  defines.

2003-03-12 09:11  bagder

	* curl-style.el: support a few more common typedefs

2003-03-12 09:07  bagder

	* configure.in: Massige use of AC_HELP_STRING() all over makes the
	  --help output so much nicer!

2003-03-11 20:22  bagder

	* CHANGES: another week of changes, especially libtool gave us an
	  adventure to remember

2003-03-11 20:12  bagder

	* lib/sendf.c: syntax error

2003-03-11 20:07  bagder

	* lib/sendf.c: Christophe Demory fixed the check to work better for
	  non-blocking on HP-UX systems. Bug report #701749.

2003-03-11 19:58  bagder

	* lib/: ftp.c, ftp.h, url.c: Use ssize_t instead of 'int' to make
	  the 64 bit sparc compiler happier.  Fix by Richard Gorton.

2003-03-11 19:55  bagder

	* lib/ssluse.c: Richard Gorton improved the random_the_seed()
	  function for systems where we don't find/know of a good random
	  source. This way, we get a better randomness which in turn should
	  make SSL connections more secure.

2003-03-11 18:16  bagder

	* configure.in: don't check for netinet/if_ether.h, we don't
	  include it and it causes configure warnings on many systems

2003-03-11 17:28  bagder

	* lib/connect.c: Martin C. Martin's fix to produce an error message
	  in case of failure in the Curl_is_connected() function.

2003-03-10 21:46  bagder

	* docs/TODO: added things to fix at the next major release/change

2003-03-10 21:43  bagder

	* docs/libcurl/curl_multi_remove_handle.3: clarify

2003-03-10 18:01  bagder

	* docs/examples/getinmemory.c: no the data is not freed, this is
	  left for the app to do when needed

2003-03-10 15:52  bagder

	* ltmain.sh: AAAARG

	  libtool 1.4.3 is scary as hell and caused just about every build
	  on all sorts of platforms to stop working, thanks to the fact
	  that it ruquires a SED variables somehow set by the configure
	  script. It works fine on my linux running autoconf 2.57 and
	  automake 1.7 but others seem not to do as fine.

	  Reverting back to the ltmain.sh we had previously, which I
	  believe is 1.4.2 including handmade patches for FreeBSD.

	  ALERT ALERT ALERT before we try 1.4.3 or similar versions again,
	  check the ${SED} stuff and similar carefully.

2003-03-10 13:25  bagder

	* include/curl/multi.h: Include sys/types.h as well. Ray DeGennaro
	  reports successful compiling on AIX when this fix is applied and
	  I cannot see how this will break any systems.

2003-03-07 14:36  bagder

	* configure.in: figure out the path to a 'sed' as otherwise libtool
	  gets crazy

2003-03-07 10:03  bagder

	* config.guess, config.sub, ltmain.sh: libtoolize 1.4.3 brought
	  these

2003-03-04 07:41  bagder

	* CHANGES: Removed define, risc os build, POST-GET bug fixed, AIX
	  4.3 problems solved and two makefiles fixed.

2003-03-04 00:26  bagder

	* maketgz: output the md5sum as the last step

2003-03-03 23:39  bagder

	* lib/: Makefile.b32, Makefile.b32.resp, Makefile.vc6: Added
	  share.obj

2003-03-03 23:31  bagder

	* configure.in: moved the disable-thread warning to the switch code
	  so that the AIX 4.3 automatic disable won't cause a warning

2003-03-03 23:30  bagder

	* configure.in: Detect AIX 4.3 or later, and if found disable the
	  check for the thread-safe *_r() functions as they're not needed
	  (and if fact mess things up for us).	Brought to our attention by
	  the friendly Troels Walsted Hansen in bug report #696217.

2003-03-03 23:23  bagder

	* lib/hostip.c: AIX 4.3 or later should use gethostbyname() and not
	  the *_r() version.

2003-03-03 07:45  bagder

	* lib/http.c: Added typecast to please the MSVC compiler.

2003-03-03 07:42  bagder

	* lib/telnet.c: another typecast added to please the borland
	  compiler

2003-03-03 07:40  bagder

	* lib/telnet.c: Add (void) on our uses of the swrite() macro when
	  we don't read the return code as this makes compiler warnings. We
	  *should* fix the code to deal with the return codes instead...

2003-03-02 18:43  bagder

	* lib/http.c: Init postdata properly before issuing a request, so
	  that there isn't any lingering POST-stuff that confuses GET
	  requests. Juan F. Codagnone reported this problem in bug report
	  #653859.

2003-03-02 18:20  bagder

	* lib/telnet.c: moved a variable declaration to remove a compiler
	  warnings with the MSVC compiler, mentioned by Andi Jahja

2003-02-28 16:50  bagder

	* lib/url.c: include the engine stuff

2003-02-28 16:49  bagder

	* lib/Makefile.m32, src/Makefile.m32: Andres Garcia Garcia updated
	  to build with the most recent OpenSSL and the recent libcurl
	  changes.

2003-02-28 14:11  bagder

	* lib/: if2ip.c, if2ip.h: James Bursa made it compile on RISC OS as
	  well.

2003-02-28 14:10  bagder

	* docs/INSTALL: James Bursa wrote a section about cross-compiling
	  for RISC OS

2003-02-28 13:20  bagder

	* src/main.c, src/writeout.c, lib/ssluse.c, lib/telnet.c: the
	  strequal and strnequal should now be called with the proper curl_
	  prefix

2003-02-28 13:17  bagder

	* include/curl/curl.h: Removed the defines for strequal() and
	  strnequal().

2003-02-28 09:40  bagder

	* CHANGES: recent stuff

2003-02-28 08:55  bagder

	* tests/FILEFORMAT: mention what happens if size is set to -1

2003-02-28 08:53  bagder

	* docs/libcurl/curl_easy_setopt.3: spell out that POSTFIELDS should
	  be url-encoded in most cases

2003-02-28 00:10  bagder

	* lib/ssluse.c: spell better

2003-02-27 15:25  bagder

	* docs/libcurl/curl_multi_info_read.3: Updated to better reflect
	  reality. Also displays how the CURLMsg struct looks like.

2003-02-27 13:50  bagder

	* lib/ftp.c: It appears that there are FTP-servers that return size
	  0 for files when SIZE is used on the file while being in BINARY
	  mode. To work around that (stupid) behavior, we attempt to parse
	  the RETR response even if the SIZE returned size zero.

	  Debugging help from Salvatore Sorrentino on February 26, 2003.

2003-02-26 18:09  bagder

	* tests/data/: test138, Makefile.am: test138 is for RETR without
	  size and without a working SIZE

2003-02-26 18:05  bagder

	* tests/ftpserver.pl: support <size>-1</size> to completely disable
	  the SIZE command

2003-02-26 17:57  bagder

	* tests/ftpserver.pl: added support for RETRNOSIZE in the control
	  file to tell RETR to not include size in the 150-reply

2003-02-26 17:56  bagder

	* tests/data/test137: added a test case for RETR that doesn't get
	  the size in the 150-reply

2003-02-26 14:46  bagder

	* docs/Makefile.am: added index.html

2003-02-26 14:01  bagder

	* docs/MANUAL: random updates

2003-02-26 13:42  bagder

	* lib/transfer.c: No longer loop to read multiple times before
	  returning back from the transfer function, as this could easily
	  end up looping for a very long time (more or less until the whole
	  transfer was done) and no library-using app would want that.

	  Found thanks to a report by Kyle Sallee.

2003-02-25 09:52  bagder

	* docs/FAQ: updated, now features less mentions about older
	  versions

2003-02-25 09:36  bagder

	* docs/FAQ: better sslcerts link

2003-02-24 19:14  bagder

	* CHANGES, CVS-INFO, Makefile.am, docs/TODO, include/curl/curl.h,
	  src/version.h, tests/server/sws.c: 7.10.4-pre2 commit

2003-02-24 17:53  bagder

	* lib/: http.c, transfer.c, urldata.h: Fixes to bring back the the
	  "Expect: 100-continue" functionality. If the header is used, we
	  must wait for a 100-code (or timeout), before we send the data.
	  The timeout is merely 1000 ms at this point. We may have reason
	  to set a longer timeout in the future.

2003-02-24 15:50  bagder

	* docs/libcurl/curl_easy_setopt.3: how to disable FTP PORT

2003-02-17 10:15  bagder

	* testcurl.sh: This script clearly misses to remove the build dir

	  "build-*" when the script starts.

2003-02-17 10:02  bagder

	* docs/curl.1: mention --trace and --trace-ascii in the
	  -v/--versbose section to remind people how to get even more

2003-02-14 10:03  bagder

	  fd_set stuff properly on all systems

2003-02-14 10:01  bagder

2003-02-05 08:43  bagder

	* lib/ssluse.c: Re-arranged the SSL connection code (again). The
	  recent fix was not a very good one. This should work fine again.

	* lib/ssluse.c: Improved error reporting in case of bad

	  multi-thread friendly.

2003-02-03 23:15  bagder

	* tests/stunnel.pm: scan through the PATH as well, to find stunnel

2003-02-03 22:36  bagder

	* src/main.c, docs/curl.1: Julian Noble pointed out that capath is

	  that don't support symlinks.

2003-01-31 08:07  bagder

	* lib/Makefile.m32: Kevin Roth corrected the zlib stuff to work

2003-01-30 06:15  bagder

	* src/main.c: curl now uses stricter VERIFYHOST by default and only
	  uses a lesser check if --insecure is used. Reported by Hamish
	  Mackenzie.

2003-01-30 06:04  bagder

	* lib/transfer.c: Fixes bug #669059. We now extract the
	  Content-Type better and more accurate.

	  the Content-Type extraction does not stop on the first space
	  anymore but cuts off the trailing spaces only.

	  Bug report #669059.

2003-01-29 14:56  bagder

	* CHANGES: changes from the last week or so

2003-01-29 14:16  bagder

	  DEBUGFUNCTION was called with bad data on uploads.

2003-01-29 13:14  bagder

2003-01-29 12:55  bagder

	* curl-mode.el: this is the former emacs file we no longer use, go
	  with curl-style.el and be happy!

2003-01-29 11:54  bagder

	* lib/ftp.c: reset conn->size to -1 on the ftp-do function to make
	  it not go on to ftp_done() with the previous transfer's value, as
	  Dave Halbakken found out.  He also verified this fixed corrected
	  the problem.

2003-01-29 11:17  bagder

	* CHANGES: previous changes

2003-01-29 11:14  bagder

	* lib/hash.c: removed weirdo {{{ and }}} comments removed emacs
	  local-variables stuff

	* curl-style.el: revised and better

2003-01-27 15:26  bagder

	  at this point.

2003-01-27 15:19  bagder

	* lib/krb4.c: Removed the long-living compiler warnings on the
	  des_pcbc_encrypt() function calls!

2003-01-27 14:51  bagder

	  netrc-tests) were counted as skipped twice, and thus the total
	  number of tests appeared wrong

	* docs/examples/fopen.c: made it work made it cause less compiler
	  warnings made it require 7.9.7 to build

	* tests/server/getpart.c: added a default to the switch() in order
	  to prevent a compiler warning

2003-01-23 08:37  bagder

2003-01-23 07:15  bagder

2003-01-22 19:30  bagder

	* include/curl/multi.h: extern C this to work in C++ conditions

2003-01-22 13:29  bagder

	* testcurl.sh: reversed the actions on the cmp check for detecting
	  if we're re-running a test on the same CVS setup as previous, as
	  they seemed to be wrong.

	  We're not actually using the result for anything at this point
	  though.

	* testcurl.sh: use LANG set to C to prevent localized dates etc

2003-01-21 18:25  bagder

	* COPYING: updated copyright years

2003-01-21 17:03  bagder

	  should run verbose tests but not stop on single failures

2003-01-21 11:33  bagder

	* testcurl.sh: use 'make test-full' instead of only 'make test' as
	  it gives a lot of more info in case of failures

2003-01-21 11:32  bagder

	  verbose mode.

2003-01-21 11:29  bagder

	  ftps-server as well

2003-01-21 11:14  bagder

2003-01-06 07:17  bumblebury

	* lib/easy.c: fix bug (?) :-)

	  previously, if you called curl_easy_perform and then set the
	  global dns cache, the global cache wouldn't be used.	I don't see
	  this really happening in practice, but this code allows you to do
	  it.

2002-12-29 17:27  bagder

	* lib/sendf.c: return -1 even if SSL_pending() doesn't return
	  non-zero, as we don't really care how many bytes that is readable
	  NOW. Philippe Raoult reported the bug in 7.10.3-pre3.

2002-12-29 17:23  bagder

	* docs/curl.1: Marc Herbert's suggstion: mention that insecure is
	  ignored if cacert or capath is used.

2002-12-20 17:00  bagder

	* CVS-INFO: example configure command line

2002-12-20 16:54  bagder

	* configure.in: Use AM_MAINTAINER_MODE which thus makes less
	  maintainer stuff in the default makefile when
	  --enable-maintainer-mode is not used.

2002-12-20 10:03  bagder

	* include/curl/curl.h, src/version.h: 7.10.3-commit

	* lib/base64.c: Curl_base64_decode() fixed by Matthew B

2002-12-19 16:45  bagder

	* lib/sendf.c: Fixed the usage of SSL_read() to properly return -1
	  if the EWOULDBLOCK situation occurs, which it previously didn't!

	  This was reptoed by Evan Jordan in bug report #653022.

	  Also, if ERROR_SYSCALL is returned from SSL_write(), include the
	  errno number in the error string for easier error detection.

2002-12-19 16:22  bagder

	* docs/libcurl-the-guide: CURLOPT_DNS_USE_GLOBAL_CACHE is not
	  thread-safe

2002-12-18 17:51  bagder

	* docs/libcurl/libcurl-errors.3, include/curl/curl.h,
	  lib/transfer.c: CURLE_HTTP_NOT_FOUND => CURLE_HTTP_RETURNED_ERROR

2002-12-17 11:05  bagder

	* lib/connect.c: Removed weird special multi interface condition
	  that caused bug report #651464.

2002-12-17 10:40  bagder

	* tests/libtest/Makefile.am: don't install the test programs

2002-12-16 18:33  bagder

	* docs/libcurl/curl_easy_setopt.3: writefunction data is not zero
	  terminated

2002-12-16 16:32  bagder

	* tests/data/: test503, test504: removed junk

2002-12-16 16:30  bagder

	* tests/: data/Makefile.am, data/test504, libtest/Makefile.am,
	  libtest/lib504.c: Added test case 504, using multi interface and
	  a local proxy without anything listening on the port we use.

2002-12-16 16:05  bagder

	* tests/data/test503: better desc

2002-12-16 15:50  bagder

	* tests/data/test503: mistake, this only requires http

2002-12-16 12:40  bagder

	* CHANGES: the hostip.c commit

2002-12-16 12:33  bagder

	* lib/hostip.c: EAGAIN on older (correct) glibc versions indicate a
	  problem and not the need for a bigger buffer and this is indeed
	  badness for us. Making this work on both old and new glibc
	  versions require an ugly loop that in its worse form cause 45 bad
	  loops when using the correct glibc and a non-resolving host
	  name... :-/

	  We want a better fix. Badly.

2002-12-16 11:55  bagder

	* CHANGES: changes from last week

2002-12-16 11:31  bagder

	* tests/libtest/Makefile.am: added 503

2002-12-13 17:21  bagder

	  keeps track of if this connection is connected or not

2002-12-13 15:14  bagder

	* tests/libtest/: Makefile.am, test.h: include files without the
	  curl/ to reduce the risk of us including the wrong set of include
	  files during tests

2002-12-13 14:47  bagder

	* lib/connect.c: make a little work-around for file:// in
	  _is_connected() and voila, now the multi interface works with
	  file:// URLs fine (previously it crashed). This won't make it
	  work on Windows though...

2002-12-13 14:41  bagder

	* tests/data/test502: one slash too many

2002-12-13 14:40  bagder

	* tests/libtest/: Makefile.am, lib502.c: lib502.c for multi
	  interface tests on a single URL without select()

2002-12-13 14:39  bagder

	  " Cut off name from option

2002-12-11 12:42  bagder

	  better on Windows(!)

2002-12-10 14:11  bagder

	* CHANGES: recent fluff

2002-12-10 14:10  bagder

	* lib/: http.c, transfer.c, urldata.h: The initial HTTP request can
	  now be sent in multiple parts, as part of the regular transfer
	  process. This required some new tweaks, like for example we need
	  to be able to tell the tranfer loop to not chunky-encode uploads
	  while we're transferring the rest of the request...

2002-12-10 14:08  bagder

	* lib/sendf.h: send_buffer is no more here

2002-12-10 14:01  bagder

	* tests/data/Makefile.am: added test56, nearly 100KB big!

2002-12-10 14:00  bagder

	* tests/data/test56: Test case for sending insanely big HTTP
	  requests. Mainly done this way to make sure that it isn't all
	  sent off in one single send() but instead really tests the
	  multiple-part-send logic.

2002-12-10 13:59  bagder

	* tests/server/sws.c: more logging, now logs the full response too,
	  basic support for dealing with chunked transfer-encoding uploads
	  added

2002-12-09 17:05  bagder

	* lib/: http.c, urldata.h: A normal POST now provides data to the
	  main transfer loop via the usual read callback, and thus won't
	  put a lot of stress on the request sending code (which currently
	  does an ugly loop).

2002-12-09 16:37  bagder

	* lib/: ftp.c, http.c, ssluse.c, transfer.c, url.c, urldata.h: The
	  fread() callback pointer and associated pointer is now stored in
	  the connectdata struct instead, and is no longer modified within
	  the 'set' struct as previously (which was a really BAAAD thing).

2002-12-09 15:39  bagder

	* docs/libcurl-the-guide: Added a default headers section and also
	  made some minor details more up-to-date with recent changes.

2002-12-05 20:39  bagder

	* src/main.c: better errno include and no extern

2002-12-05 15:26  bagder

	* lib/transfer.c: read and write as much as possible until end of
	  data or EWOULDBLOCK before returning back to the select() loop.
	  Consider this a test so far.

2002-12-05 13:54  bagder

	* perl/contrib/formfind: deal with spaces in name and value tags a
	  lot better!

2002-12-05 12:26  bagder

	* lib/krb4.h: changed proto for Curl_krb_kauth()

2002-12-05 12:25  bagder

	* src/main.c: Solaris needs errno as an extern int.

2002-12-04 12:06  bagder

	* lib/setup.h, src/setup.h: make WIN32 defined for Borland
	  properly, as told by Alexander J. Oss

2002-12-04 10:53  bagder

	* UPGRADE: called SSLCERTS now

2002-12-04 10:09  bagder

	* CHANGES, include/curl/curl.h, src/version.h: 7.10.3-pre2

2002-12-04 09:56  bagder

	* lib/ftp.c: The waiting for the 226 or 250 line expected to come
	  after a transfer is complete is now only made for 60 seconds and
	  if no data was received during those 60 seconds, we store a
	  special error message (preparing to make this a special error
	  code) as this most likely means that the control connection has
	  died while we were transferring data.

2002-12-03 13:41  bagder

	* src/main.c: missing }

2002-12-03 13:40  bagder

	* docs/libcurl/: curl_easy_setopt.3, curl_multi_perform.3,
	  libcurl-multi.3: clarified

2002-12-03 13:34  bagder

	* docs/examples/multi-double.c: Jeff pointed out this flaw in the
	  example

2002-12-03 12:13  bagder

	* docs/curl.1: -@ is no longer an official shortcut for
	  --create-dirs

2002-12-03 12:12  bagder

	* src/main.c: don't officially use -@ for --create-dirs, only use
	  the long form

2002-12-03 11:37  bagder

	* docs/libcurl/curl_easy_setopt.3: clarify the DEBUGFUNCTION data
	  not being zero terminated

2002-12-03 11:25  bagder

	* lib/: ftp.c, ftp.h, krb4.c, security.c, urldata.h:
	  Curl_GetFTPResponse() takes a different set of parameters and now
	  return a proper CURLcode. The default timeout for reading one
	  response is now also possible to change while running.

2002-12-03 10:32  bagder

	* lib/: Makefile.b32, Makefile.b32.resp: updated to reality

2002-12-03 09:07  bagder

	  patch

2002-12-02 15:40  bagder

	* docs/curl.1: Nicolas Berloquin's description of his
	  -@/--create-dirs fix

2002-12-02 15:37  bagder

	* src/main.c: Nicolas Berloquin's added code for dealing with
	  -@/--create-dirs to create the necessary directories as specified
	  with -o.

2002-12-02 08:18  bagder

	* lib/ftp.c: if the PWD reply parser failed, we leaked memory

	  SSL_VERIFYHOST a bit, thanks to Soren Spies

	* lib/.cvsignore: more to ignore

2002-12-01 12:20  bagder

	* lib/http.c: only use Content-Length: header if not transfering
	  data chunked

2002-11-30 17:00  bagder

	* docs/INSTALL: mention CVS-INFO for more info when checked out
	  from CVS removed old section about problems with old autoconfs, I
	  don't think that happens anymore

	* CHANGES: stuff done since the 7.10.2 release

2002-11-29 09:12  bagder

	* lib/multi.c: fix the hash init to call the correct dns cleanup
	  function

2002-11-28 16:48  bagder

	* lib/http.h: added compareheader proto

2002-11-28 16:46  bagder

	* lib/transfer.c: compareheader() was moved over to http.c and got
	  a Curl_ prefix

	  The chunked transfer upload never stopped due to a silly add
	  before we checked for >0!

2002-11-28 16:45  bagder

	* lib/http.c: Moved the compareheader function into this file and
	  added Curl_ prefix We now check if the chunked transfer-encoding
	  header has been added "by force" and if so, we enabled the chunky
	  upload!

2002-11-28 15:07  bagder

	* docs/CONTRIBUTE: mention how to generate patches

2002-11-28 14:29  bagder

	* configure.in: bad use of AM_CONDITIONAL removed and now configure
	  runs better when used with --disable-ipv6 --without-zlib

2002-11-27 12:59  bagder

	* README: execve.net is an official download mirror in HK

	* src/main.c: removed extra space from trace output 'Send data'

2002-11-26 10:41  bagder

	* lib/: easy.c, hostip.c, hostip.h: fixed Curl_freeaddrinfo() to
	  only free addrinfo, and added Curl_freednsinfo() for freeing
	  single dns cache entries

2002-11-26 03:12  subman

	* lib/curllib.dsp: Removed MFC dependency in Release Build when
	  using VC++ IDE

	  today

2002-11-22 14:48  bagder

	  lib/getinfo.c, lib/url.c, lib/urldata.h: Kjetil Jacobsen's patch
	  that introduces CURLOPT_PRIVATE and CURLINFO_PRIVATE for storage
	  and retrieval of private data in the curl handle.

2002-11-20 20:04  bagder

	* curl-config.in: Karol Pietrzak pointed out that simply including
	  the include dir in --cflags is not a good thing, as recent gccs
	  for example complain if it is /usr/include

	  Right now, we just output "" until we think of something better.

2002-11-18 23:10  bagder

	* CHANGES, include/curl/curl.h, src/version.h: 7.10.2

2002-11-18 22:58  bagder

	* lib/Makefile.am: dllinit.c is removed

2002-11-13 23:16  bagder

2002-11-12 00:03  bagder

	  ConnectBits where the other bools already are

2002-11-11 23:51  bagder

	* lib/: hostip.c, url.c: The test for DNS cache entries left locked
	  is now only built if AGGRESIVE_TEST is also defined, as an
	  addition to MALLOCDEBUG. It doesn't work for multi interface
	  usage and should only be used with careful consideration.

2002-11-11 23:41  bagder

	* SSLCERTS: changed header

2002-11-11 23:38  bagder

	* Makefile.am: include SSLCERTS and not UPGRADE. We leave UPGRADE a
	  while in CVS, but it should be removed soonish.

2002-11-11 23:37  bagder

	* SSLCERTS: UPGRADE was renamed into this "SSLCERTS"

2002-11-11 23:36  bagder

	* lib/: connect.c, ftp.c, hostip.h, url.c: unlock dns cache entries
	  with a function call instead of a variable fiddle

	  size of the uploaded file is unknown.

2002-11-07 09:45  bagder

	* lib/url.c: Bug report #634625 identified how curl returned
	  timeout immediately when CURLOPT_CONNECTTIMEOUT was used and
	  provided a fix.

2002-11-06 09:30  bagder

	* CHANGES: recent changes

	  sent on errors when debug wasn't enabled

2002-11-05 12:07  bagder

	* lib/: connect.c, ftp.c, url.c: ipv4-fixes for the new
	  Curl_dns_entry struct and Curl_resolv() proto

2002-11-05 11:51  bagder

	* lib/: connect.c, connect.h, ftp.c, hash.c, hash.h, hostip.c,
	  hostip.h, url.c, url.h, urldata.h: Curl_resolv() now returns a
	  different struct, and it contains a reference counter so that the
	  caller needs to decrease that counter when done with the returned
	  data.

	  If compiled with MALLOCDEBUG I've added some extra checking that
	  the counter is decreased before a handle is closed etc.

	* CVS-INFO: Soren Spies filled in some info about Mac OS X 10.2

2002-10-31 14:09  bagder

	* lib/hostip.c: Disable the DNS cache (by setting the timeout to 0)
	  made libcurl leak memory. Avery Fay brought the example code that
	  proved this.

2002-10-28 23:19  bagder

	* lib/transfer.c: when using checkprefix(), the first argument must
	  be the prefix!

2002-10-28 22:52  bagder

	* lib/transfer.c: Transfer-Encoding: needs 17 bytes passed, not 18

2002-10-28 22:52  bagder

	* lib/: cookie.c, formdata.c, strequal.h, transfer.c, url.c:
	  kromJx@crosswinds.net's fix that now uses checkprefix() instead
	  of strnequal() when the third argument was strlen(first argument)
	  anyway.  This makes it less prone to errors. (Slightly edited by
	  me)

2002-10-28 22:05  bagder

	* lib/README.memoryleak: the malloc debug system assumes single
	  thread

2002-10-28 21:58  bagder

	* docs/MANUAL: kromJx@crosswinds.net fixed typos

2002-10-28 21:39  bagder

	* configure.in: works now with autoconf 2.54

2002-10-28 20:49  bagder

	* src/main.c: Kevin Roth's patch that checks for the CA cert file
	  at two more places if the --cacert option is not used.

	  1. An environment variable named CURL_CA_BUNDLE may contain the
	  full file name to the file.

	  2. On Windows, the cert file may be named curl-ca-bundle.crt and
	  put in the same dir as curl is located (or the CWD) and curl will
	  then use that file instead.

2002-10-28 20:39  bagder

	* src/Makefile.m32: Kevin Roth's patch. $(RM) instead of @erase,
	  and it also passes on the USE_SSLEAY variable

2002-10-28 20:38  bagder

	* lib/Makefile.m32: Kevin Roth's fixes that use $(RM) instead of
	  @erase and modified SSL version

2002-10-28 20:24  bagder

	* configure.in: fixed the cygwin check for -no-undefined

2002-10-23 16:15  bagder

	* include/curl/curl.h: improved the check for an ISO cpp by
	  checking specificly for __BORLANDC__ too, as Emiliano Ida has
	  confirmed it to work

2002-10-23 16:07  bagder

	* tests/: ftpsserver.pl, httpsserver.pl: kromJx@crosswinds.net made
	  it run properly with stunnel >=4.0

2002-10-23 15:48  bagder

	* lib/: transfer.c, urldata.h: bad headers can come in two kinds,
	  we either treat everything as one big badly assumed header, or we
	  think that parts of the buffer is a bad header and the rest is
	  treated as a normal body part

2002-10-21 16:04  bagder

	* CHANGES: another week, 7 fixes

2002-10-21 15:20  bagder

	* lib/hostip.c: glibc 2.2.93 gethostbyname_r() no longer returns
	  ERANGE if the given buffer size isn't big enough. For some reason
	  they now return EAGAIN.

	  Redhat 8 ships with this glibc version.

2002-10-21 14:07  bagder

	* lib/transfer.c: Nikita Schmidt's fix to debian bug report
	  #165382. This is verified with the new test case 55.

2002-10-21 14:02  bagder

	* tests/data/: Makefile.am, test55: Added test 55, follow location
	  with a single slash in the original path.  This caused curl
	  7.10.1 to crash.

2002-10-21 08:49  bagder

	* configure.in, lib/Makefile.am: check for cygwin and if built on
	  that, enable the no-undefined option for libtool. Otherwise
	  disable it.

2002-10-21 08:18  bagder

	* tests/data/: Makefile.am, test54: test 54 added, blank Location:
	  field

2002-10-21 07:52  bagder

	* configure.in: --enable-debug now checks if gcc is used before it
	  sets all those gcc- specific options. This should make this
	  option work on more platforms with other compilers.

2002-10-18 17:28  bagder

	* lib/transfer.c: make very sure that we return 'done' properly
	  when a transfer is done, as otherwise the multi interface gets
	  problems

2002-10-18 17:27  bagder

	* lib/multi.c: return call_multi when we follow a location

2002-10-18 15:51  bagder

	* lib/transfer.c: if we found no string on the Location: line,
	  don't try to follow it

2002-10-18 09:55  bagder

	* packages/Win32/cygwin/Makefile.am: moved comments to first column
	  and automake stopped complaining

2002-10-17 09:10  bagder

	* lib/: transfer.c, url.c, urldata.h: Make the COOKIESESSION work
	  better by creating a list of cookie files files when given in the
	  curl_easy_setopt() and then parse them all on the first
	  curl_easy_perform() call instead.

2002-10-17 09:03  bagder

	* tests/data/: Makefile.am, test53: junk cookies test53 added

2002-10-16 11:53  bagder

	* docs/libcurl/curl_formadd.3: mucho fixed

2002-10-15 16:18  bagder

	* docs/libcurl/: curl_easy_setopt.3, curl_multi_fdset.3,
	  curl_multi_perform.3, curl_multi_remove_handle.3: Andrs Garca's
	  corrections

2002-10-14 09:47  bagder

	* docs/: .cvsignore, libcurl/.cvsignore: ignore .ps and .pdf files
	  too

2002-10-14 09:39  bagder

	* Makefile.am, maketgz, docs/Makefile.am, docs/libcurl/Makefile.am:
	  generate and include PDF versions of the docs in the release
	  archive

2002-10-13 12:34  bagder

	* lib/: Makefile.am, README.memoryleak: my first take at a memory
	  leak detection document

	* docs/MANUAL: -y and -Y was switched in the examples

2002-10-12 13:18  bagder

	* lib/connect.c: return error properly when a non-blocking connect
	  fails using the multi interface

2002-10-11 22:55  bagder

	* lib/transfer.c: When we receive a "bad header" we must sure not
	  to write down the data part as well, as then we write the same
	  data twice.

2002-10-11 19:44  bagder

	* src/main.c: fix bad free() that caused segfault

2002-10-11 15:25  bagder

	* include/curl/curl.h, src/version.h: 7.10.1 commit

2002-10-10 10:04  bagder

	* CHANGES: more

2002-10-10 10:00  bagder

	* lib/: http.c, url.c: Jeff Lawson fixed a few problems with
	  connection re-use that remained when you set CURLOPT_PROXY to "".

2002-10-09 15:03  bagder

	* lib/transfer.c: Junk data could get inserted when saving/getting
	  HTTP headers, as discovered by Craig Davison. Now we deal with
	  the 'nread' variable correctly between each header line.

2002-10-08 18:10  bagder

	* lib/sendf.c: failf() now sends the text to the debug function
	  callback

2002-10-08 15:30  bagder

	* docs/curl-config.1: set version and date

2002-10-08 15:30  bagder

	* configure.in: rewrote the --with-zlib check, based on Albert
	  Chin's input.

2002-10-08 11:24  bagder

	* docs/curl.1: 7.10 not 7.9.9 (there never was one named that)

2002-10-08 09:16  bagder

	* docs/FAQ: 5.7 Link errors when building libcurl on Windows!

2002-10-08 09:11  bagder

	* docs/CONTRIBUTE: more blurb

2002-10-08 08:50  bagder

	* packages/Win32/cygwin/Makefile.am: Kevin's fix to use DESTDIR
	  instead of prefix on make install

2002-10-07 20:23  bagder

	* docs/Makefile.am: added libcurl-the-guide to the dist

2002-10-07 15:38  bagder

	* lib/multi.c: Following locations properly, if told to do so.

2002-10-07 15:38  bagder

	* lib/: transfer.c, transfer.h: Move the URL concat code to
	  Curl_follow(), and added a proto for that function. For Location:
	  following.

2002-10-07 11:04  bagder

	* lib/Makefile.am: Kevin Roth pointed out that 'make install'
	  failed if built outside the sourcedir if we're not using
	  $(srcdir) properly.

2002-10-07 09:38  bagder

	* packages/Win32/cygwin/README: Kevin's update

2002-10-04 16:27  bagder

	* CHANGES: fixes since 7.10

2002-10-04 16:26  bagder

	* lib/Makefile.am: The -no-undefined flag is CRUCIAL for this to
	  build fine on Cygwin. If we find a case in which we need to
	  remove this flag, we should most likely write a configure check
	  that detects when this flag is needed and when its not.

2002-10-04 16:15  bagder

	* lib/transfer.c: as Ralph Mitchell pointed out, the Location:
	  following code needs some basic ./ and ../ strip-off
	  understanding, and this change introduces with.  test cases 49 -
	  52 test this.

2002-10-04 16:06  bagder

	* tests/data/: Makefile.am, test49, test50, test51, test52: new
	  redirect tests with ./ and ../

	  missing in the tarballs

2002-10-01 13:16  bagder

	* configure.in: --with-libz and --without-libz are now supported

2002-10-01 10:57  bagder

2002-09-30 21:51  bagder

	* docs/libcurl/curl_version_info.3, include/curl/curl.h,
	  lib/version.c: get an argument and add a 'age' field to the
	  struct

2002-09-30 10:07  bagder

	* lib/hostip.c: Cris Bailiff found this flaw, gethostbyname_r() on
	  linux returns 0 even when it can't lookup the name (at least in
	  some cases) and thus we need to make an extra check to detect
	  failures.

2002-09-27 11:51  bagder

	* docs/curl.1: "" proxy means no proxy

2002-09-27 11:49  bagder

	* lib/url.c: Allow a "" proxy explicitly set dont-use-proxy, i.e
	  don't even check the environment variables or anything. Setting
	  it to NULL disables proxy as well, but allows the environment
	  variables to kick in and be used.

2002-09-26 15:16  bagder

	* docs/: index.html, libcurl/index.html: point out more docs

2002-09-26 15:12  bagder

	* CHANGES, docs/libcurl/Makefile.am,

2002-09-25 14:47  bagder

	* lib/http.c: make sure we free rangeline before we re-assign it to
	  a new allocated memory as otherwise we (might) leak memory

2002-09-25 14:27  bagder

	* include/curl/curl.h: curl_free proto added

2002-09-25 14:26  bagder

2002-09-25 14:11  bagder

	  Walter J. Mack's curl_free addition

2002-09-25 13:27  bagder

	* lib/url.c: Andrs Garca found out that Curl_protocol_connect()
	  could return an uninitialized variable.

2002-09-25 09:08  bagder

	* include/curl/curl.h, lib/url.c, lib/version.c: Wez Furlong's
	  curl_version_info() function added, still needs some adjustments
	  and possibly some improvments to feature all those things we
	  could possibly want from this.

2002-09-23 17:01  bagder

	* CHANGES: 5 changes since pre3

2002-09-23 15:27  bagder

	* include/curl/curl.h: made the resume error more suitable for all
	  protocols, but we provide a fallback to the old ftp-one to make
	  old programs work the same

2002-09-23 15:22  bagder

	* src/main.c: fix resume when multiple files were specified

2002-09-23 14:55  bagder

	  code work with resumes in the same style other code does.

2002-09-23 14:44  bagder

	* lib/multi.c: properly disconnect failed connections

2002-09-20 16:40  bagder

	* lib/ftp.c: Craig Markwardt made the "struct hostent_data" get
	  cleared too, as is needed on Tru64 (or something).

2002-09-18 17:26  bagder

	* docs/libcurl/curl_easy_setopt.3: Re-ordered all the options to be
	  more logically structured. Hopefully this will make this page
	  more readable and easy to find things in!

2002-09-16 16:02  bagder

	* lib/transfer.c: a follow-up fix to the previous fix for HTTP
	  servers that don't reply *any* headers at all

2002-09-13 14:40  bagder

	* lib/: http.c, transfer.c, urldata.h: better deal with HTTP(S)
	  servers that respond with no headers at all, test case 306 added
	  to verify that we do right

	* docs/.cvsignore: ignore html files here

2002-09-11 10:49  bagder

2002-08-30 13:09  bagder

	  CURLE_SSL_INSECURE is removed again and so is
	  CURLOPT_SSL_INSECURE, we proceed fine with the already existing
	  options, just having a different internal library default for
	  capath.

2002-08-30 13:02  bagder

	* lib/Makefile.am: support DESTDIR for the bundle

2002-08-30 13:00  bagder

	* include/curl/curl.h, lib/http.c, lib/url.c, lib/urldata.h,
	  src/main.c: SOCKS5 support added (contributed by a still unnamed

	* configure.in, lib/Makefile.am, lib/ca-bundle.h.in: ca-bundle
	  stuff for configure and generated header file

	* docs/FAQ: more explicit texts on the 4.2 answer

2002-08-29 08:09  bagder

	* lib/: transfer.c, urldata.h: remove the data and conn fields from
	  the Curl_transfer_keeper struct, they weren't used anyway and
	  mostly caused confusion

2002-08-27 01:13  bagder

	* include/curl/curl.h, lib/ftp.c, lib/url.c, lib/urldata.h,
	  src/main.c: SSL_INSECURE support and usage added

	* LEGAL: corrected the year string

2002-08-26 13:58  bagder

	* docs/libcurl-the-guide: Markus F.X.J. Oberhumer added a section
	  about NOSIGNAL and libcurl in multi-threaded use

2002-08-22 21:38  bagder

2002-08-22 21:38  bagder

	  of the file.

2002-08-22 21:03  bagder

	* docs/KNOWN_BUGS: bug report #588027 converted to a KNOWN BUG, as
	  we have no intention to correct this problem within the nearest
	  period

2002-08-22 16:28  bagder

	* lib/Makefile.am: allow undefined symbols!

2002-08-21 21:04  bagder

	  clarification for the PROGRESSFUNCTION

2002-08-21 13:05  bagder

	* MITX.txt: modified the copyright line and shortened the phrasing
	  in this license to become even shorter, but retaining the same
	  meaning and effect for all users.

2002-08-20 13:46  bagder

	* lib/config-win32.h: Added three more pragmas for MSVC++ compiles.

	  We *really* need these sorted out. I'd prefer to have them all
	  removed and the actual code corrected instead of just diabling
	  the warnings and pretending that they don't exist.

2002-08-20 13:43  bagder

	* lib/dllinit.c: prevent compiler warnings

2002-08-20 13:42  bagder

	  looking for it! ;-)

2002-08-13 14:12  bagder

	* src/: config.h.in, main.c: mr Hartroth correctly pointed out that
	  poll() isn't really that portable so we need to hack around it
	  when not there

2002-08-13 13:45  bagder

	* configure.in: check for poll()

2002-08-13 08:51  bagder

	  for directing contents somewhere

	* lib/: connect.c, connect.h, ftp.c, ftp.h, multi.c, url.c, url.h,
	  urldata.h: Initial fix to make the multi interface return control
	  while waiting for the initial connect to "come through".

	  This should work fine for connect and for FTP-PASV connects.
	  Needs massive testing.

2002-08-12 11:41  bagder

	* tests/runtests.pl: redirect stderr to /dev/null when testing for
	  running test-servers

2002-08-07 10:09  bagder

	* docs/curl.1: spell out that -i should be used if you want to add
	  http headers to the output. -v does not do that

2002-08-05 19:04  bagder

	* lib/: multi.c, transfer.c, urldata.h: Make SessionHandle keep
	  record if it is used with the multi interface or the easy
	  interface, it CANNOT be used by a mixture.

2002-08-05 18:54  bagder

	* CHANGES: curl/curl.g fix, HP-UX fix, ftp port, libcurl.def, empty

	  reason during the flow of time!

	  should check for blank ones themselves if they need to prevent
	  this.

2002-08-05 11:38  bagder

	* docs/libcurl/curl_easy_setopt.3: jonatan's fixes

2002-08-03 18:38  hartroth

2002-08-01 16:25  bagder

	* lib/ftp.c: Changed the PORT command to pick a better default IP
	  address if "-" is used.  It now uses the local IP adress of the

	* include/curl/multi.h: sys/socket.h without #ifdef include
	  sys/time.h as well

	* docs/curl.1: spell fix and --limit-rate added

2002-07-30 13:07  bagder

2002-07-30 00:59  bagder

	* CHANGES: passwords and cookies

2002-07-30 00:45  bagder

	* lib/url.c: Removed checks for if set.fpasswd is NULL, as we
	  prevent users from setting it to NULL and then use the internal
	  default instead. It will always be a function to call.

2002-07-30 00:42  bagder

	* docs/libcurl/curl_easy_setopt.3: Setting PASSWDFUNCTION to NULL
	  will set back the internal function as password function.

2002-07-30 00:23  bagder

	* lib/transfer.c: fixed the Curl_cookie_add() invoke to not assume
	  a space after the colon

2002-06-26 10:03  bagder

2002-06-19 14:31  bagder

	* docs/examples/README: simplified the compile line even more

2002-06-19 14:30  bagder

	* docs/examples/: Makefile.am, simplepost.c: simplepost.c shows a
	  simple POST ;-)

2002-06-15 23:08  bagder

	* src/main.c: removed extra / in help text

2002-06-15 23:06  bagder

	* src/config.h.in: HAVE_SYS_POLL_H

2002-06-15 23:00  bagder

	* lib/: transfer.c, url.c, urldata.h: CURLOPT_BUFFERSIZE allows an
	  application to set a prefered buffer size for receiving data from
	  the network. It is meant as a hint, not as a forced limit.

2002-06-15 13:17  bagder

	* docs/libcurl/curl_formadd.3: Chris Combes added description of
	  his newly added options

2002-06-14 14:05  bagder

	  function performed a lot   faster on Windows when removing the 1
	  microsecond timeout.

2002-06-14 11:36  bagder

	* lib/: curllib.dsp, curllib.dsw: Hanno L. Kranzhoff fixed them

2002-06-14 08:57  bagder

	* lib/: ftp.c, urldata.h: Remade the FTP not-check status line and
	  not-attempt-to-read-status-line variables, conditions and things.

2002-06-14 00:22  bagder

	* lib/ftp.c: Tom Mattison's report found out, and this is the fix
	  that should prevent FTP from closing the connections a little too
	  often!

	* docs/INSTALL: Miklos Nemeth added a section for how to disable
	  specific protocols in the windows build.

	* lib/: ftp.c, urldata.h: Added 'dont_check' to be set during an
	  FTP operation if the final status message is supposed to be
	  ignored.

2002-06-13 00:05  bagder

	* lib/ftp.c: when no FTP transfer was done, don't attempt to read
	  the download transfer thing. The 'resumed' flag is also causing
	  confusions. I'll deal with that tomorrow.

2002-06-13 00:04  bagder

	* lib/transfer.c: Moved the secondarysocket cleanup. The 'conn'
	  struct may have been cleared already at that other place.

2002-06-12 23:40  bagder

	* include/curl/curl.h, lib/formdata.c, lib/formdata.h: Chris Combes
	  added CURLFORM_BUFFER, CURLFORM_BUFFERPTR, CURLFORM_BUFFERLENGTH

2002-06-12 23:40  bagder

	  options

	* lib/Makefile.m32, src/Makefile.m32: Jrn fixes for 7.9.8 build

2002-06-12 10:16  bagder

	* docs/TODO: the disable protocol stuff is now added

2002-06-11 17:11  bagder

	* tests/: FILEFORMAT, runtests.pl: more nonewline support

2002-06-11 17:10  bagder

	* configure.in, lib/hostip.c, lib/url.c: Now uses sigsetjmp() and
	  siglongjmp() to bail out from slow name lookups in case a timeout
	  is set. This seems to work. God knows if it is good enough or
	  what kind of side-effects we introduce here and now.

	  I'll close my eyes and cross my fingers. Hard.

2002-06-11 17:09  bagder

	* src/main.c: cut up the string in more pieces for <512 bytes
	  strings

2002-06-11 16:10  bagder

	* lib/url.c: removed accidentally added debug-code!

2002-06-11 14:35  bagder

	* lib/ftp.c: ftp range downloads make us ignore the final status
	  message as the server will most likely treat the download as
	  failed as we might abort it pre-maturely

2002-06-11 14:25  bagder

	* tests/data/: Makefile.am, test135: added test135 ftp byte-range
	  download

2002-06-11 13:13  bagder

	* configure.in, curl-config.in: added --disable-[protocol] support

2002-06-11 13:13  bagder

	  doing strlen() on the pointer. Bugs item #566835.

	* lib/hostip.c: getaddrinfo() failures now show port number too in
	  informational output

2002-06-10 15:25  bagder

	* lib/connect.c: added a missing failf() for certain connect
	  failures

2002-06-10 14:38  bagder

	* lib/ssluse.c: This fix MIGHT make us build nicely with OpenSSL
	  0.9.7. This fix is based on a patch from Jacob Meuser, input from
	  Gtz Babin-Ebell and my own browsing of the latest include files.

2002-06-10 14:34  bagder

	* lib/transfer.c: Gautam Mani found a socket descriptor leak that
	  happened when FTP transfers failed and you reinvoked
	  curl_easy_perform().

	  64bit architectures Bug report #564585.

2002-06-04 13:53  bagder

	* CHANGES: more stuff since pre1

2002-06-03 15:37  bagder

	* docs/BINDINGS: indent like the other ones

2002-06-03 15:20  bagder

	  windows builds

2002-06-03 14:46  bagder

	* lib/progress.c: T. Bharath fixed the TIMER_REDIRECT.

2002-05-29 00:33  bagder

	* lib/ftp.c: Getting an empty FTP file no longer makes us return
	  error 19. An empty file is fine to get.

2002-05-28 16:45  bagder

	* lib/multi.c:	Gustaf Hui provided new code that changes how
	  curl_multi_info_read()
	   messages are stored, so that they don't have to be kept around
	  for the multi
	   handle's entire life time. He also made it return failure codes
	  properly
	   which it didn't do before.

	   I made the messages only get stored per easy-handle so that they
	  can be
	   independently killed easier without ruining the "master list".
	  It makes
	   the info_read() function slightly less beautiful as it has to
	  scan for
	   messages to return, but it makes removing individual handles a
	  lot easier
	   and less error prone.

2002-05-28 16:18  bagder

	* lib/transfer.c: Adjusted to make curl_multi_perform() work
	  properly even when curl_multi_fdset() is not used.

2002-05-28 11:31  bagder

	* src/main.c: I trimmed the --help output slightly to better fit
	  within 80 cols

2002-05-28 11:21  bagder

	* docs/curl.1, docs/libcurl/curl_easy_setopt.3,
	  include/curl/curl.h, lib/url.c, src/main.c: Cris Bailiff's CAPATH

	* tests/runtests.pl: James Cone's little work-around for the strict
	  error

2002-05-22 00:24  bagder

	* lib/url.c: When re-using a connection, make sure that we use the
	  current host name as we might actually re-use a connection to a
	  different host, when using proxies!

	  This was what bug report #558888 was all about.

2002-05-22 00:22  bagder

	* include/curl/curl.h: James Cone added the new CURL_NETRC_OPTION
	  enum

2002-05-22 00:20  bagder

	* docs/FAQ: corrected see also

2002-05-21 15:53  bagder

	* docs/FAQ: 3.14 added, javascript support

2002-05-21 10:22  bagder

	* tests/server/sws.c: Added source header and made it clear that
	  this code was originally donated to us by Juergen Wilke.

2002-05-21 10:15  bagder

	* lib/ssluse.c: ASN1 files don't work for the *chain_file(), make
	  them use the previous version

2002-05-21 09:47  bagder

	* docs/libcurl/curl_formadd.3: return type CURLFORMcode instead of
	  plain int

2002-05-21 09:44  bagder

	* include/curl/curl.h, lib/formdata.c: curl_formadd() now returns
	  'CURLFORMcode' instead of int, to better enable checking for
	  particular errors. curl/curl.h defines the errros

2002-05-20 16:25  bagder

	* lib/ssluse.c: Roland Zimmermann's hint, we use
	  SSL_CTX_use_certificate_chain_file() instead of the previous one
	  that used SSL_CTX_use_certificate_file()

2002-05-17 10:15  bagder

	* tests/server/: getpart.c, sws.c: removed compiler warnings

2002-05-17 09:57  bagder

	* src/writeout.c: FreeBSD needs sys/types.h before we include
	  sys/select.h that was included mainly for AIX in the first
	  place...! As reported in bug report #556869

2002-05-17 09:49  bagder

	* lib/hostip.c: Fixes bug report #556930 - we need to make sure
	  that the data is all right after we've realloc() the packed
	  hostent struct.

2002-05-15 23:40  bagder

	* docs/FAQ: Added item 4.10 after talks with Russ Freeman

2002-05-13 09:29  bagder

	* docs/examples/: Makefile.am, win32sockets.c: we don't need
	  win32sockets.c anymore, we support this internally

2002-05-13 09:28  bagder

	* docs/examples/: Makefile.am, fopen.c: fopen.c added, a fopen()
	  style emulation for URL reading

2002-05-12 18:10  bagder

	* CHANGES: Friday's fixes

2002-05-10 18:01  bagder

	* docs/INSTALL: AIX 5.1

2002-05-10 17:59  bagder

	* src/main.c: Kein Roth made --trace-ascii look even better, and
	  make OD 0A occurances get output as plain newlines.

2002-05-10 16:37  bagder

	* src/: config.h.in, writeout.c: AIX wants sys/select.h for the
	  fd_set stuff in curl/multi.h, and even though it is a bit ugly
	  work-around to add this here, it is still a working work- around!
	  ;-)

2002-05-08 01:36  bagder

	* docs/: curl.1, libcurl/curl_easy_setopt.3: Patrick Smith's
	  contributed docs improvements for when NLST is used by curl...

2002-05-07 23:52  bagder

	* CHANGES, include/curl/curl.h, src/version.h: 7.9.7-pre2

2002-05-07 15:13  bagder

	* src/main.c: Added --trace-ascii support

2002-05-07 15:12  bagder

	* src/main.c, include/curl/curl.h, lib/cookie.c, lib/cookie.h,
	  lib/easy.c, lib/url.c, lib/urldata.h: support for ingoring
	  session cookies added

2002-05-06 20:30  bagder

	* lib/url.c: the code for case CURLOPT_DEBUGDATA code broke the
	  CURLOPT_STDERR one!

2002-05-06 15:44  bagder

	* CHANGES: recent fiddling

2002-05-06 15:43  bagder

	* docs/libcurl/curl_easy_setopt.3: CURLOPT_FILE and CURLOPT_INFILE
	  have better aliases now: CURLOPT_WRITEDATA and CURLOPT_READDATA

2002-05-06 15:38  bagder

	* docs/examples/: Makefile.am, multi-post.c: Added multi-post.c,
	  based on the source file posted by Gustaf Hui

2002-05-05 14:11  bagder

	* lib/transfer.c: Better support for being used with the multi
	  interface without the *fd_set() and proper select()ing have been
	  made.

2002-05-05 11:09  bagder

	* docs/curl.1: --trace is a 7.9.7 function

2002-05-05 11:08  bagder

	* docs/curl.1: added -Z/--max-redirs and --trace changed order of a
	  few others to keep the a-z order

2002-05-04 17:36  bagder

	* lib/sendf.c: made VERBOSE output more like it used to be,
	  HEADER_IN is thus also ignored by the internal debugfunction
	  callback

2002-05-03 16:50  bagder

	* docs/libcurl/curl_easy_setopt.3, include/curl/curl.h,
	  lib/urldata.h: CURL_MAX_WRITE_SIZE is a new exported define that
	  informs about the biggest sized buffer that may be passed to a
	  write callback

2002-05-03 14:40  bagder

	* lib/multi.c: fixed return code

2002-05-03 14:21  bagder

	* CHANGES: another week of changes

2002-05-03 14:14  bagder

	* src/main.c: - Added "--trace [file]" to the command line tool. It
	  makes a very detailed   trace dump get stored, with a full
	  protocol dump that includes all received   and transmitted data.
	  This could be a very effective tool for debugging what   goes
	  wrong. This dump includes every byte the way it is sent
	  to/received	from the server. The dump is the plain-text
	  version, so SSL transfers will   still be readable.

2002-05-03 14:07  bagder

	* lib/transfer.c: made the DEBUGFUNCTION get called properly on a
	  few more places, especially for DATA_IN and DATA_OUT.

2002-05-03 14:06  bagder

	* lib/progress.c: make sure our own printf() clones are used

2002-05-03 11:47  bagder

	* src/main.c: -D now stores all headers to the same file if
	  multiple URLs are given on the command line!

2002-05-03 00:34  bagder

	* docs/libcurl/curl_multi_fdset.3: clarified that you must keep the
	  variables that you point to!

2002-05-03 00:15  bagder

	* docs/libcurl-the-guide: spell

2002-05-03 00:14  bagder

	* lib/transfer.c: use and set the fd_set pointers instead of the
	  actual values, as then we work properly with the multi interface
	  when the user has provided the fd_sets!

2002-05-03 00:13  bagder

	* lib/urldata.h: added two pointers to the fd_set variables to
	  read/write from, as sometimes we need to point to user-provided
	  fd_sets

2002-05-03 00:12  bagder

	* lib/multi.c: return CURLM_CALL_MULTI_PERFORM in one more case,
	  and check return code from malloc()

2002-05-02 20:07  bagder

	* lib/multi.c: make sure the dns cache pointers in the easy handles
	  are NULLed

2002-05-02 10:52  bagder

	* lib/transfer.c: Hanno Kranzhoff noticed we didn't properly reset
	  the download/upload counters before transfers, when doing
	  multiple ones on the same handle.

2002-05-01 13:36  bagder

	* lib/hostip.c: Jacky Lam's fix to make the realloc() of the
	  hostent data work properly even when the realloc() actually gets
	  a new memory block

2002-04-30 09:37  bagder

	* docs/libcurl/curl_easy_setopt.3: how to set more than one cookie

2002-04-28 00:21  bagder

	* lib/multi.c: implemented curl_multi_info_read() which I had
	  forgotten before!

2002-04-27 22:19  bagder

	* CHANGES: updated some docs

2002-04-27 20:31  bagder

	* docs/BUGS: clarified

2002-04-27 20:12  bagder

	* docs/FAQ: one added, one edited

2002-04-27 20:01  bagder

	* docs/RESOURCES: shorter introduction

2002-04-27 20:00  bagder

	* docs/TODO: updated

2002-04-27 19:02  bagder

	* docs/: BINDINGS, Makefile.am: Added BINDINGS, lists all available
	  libcurl bindings as of this date.

2002-04-27 15:26  bagder

	* CHANGES: fixes on rainy saturday in the end of April, 2002

2002-04-27 15:24  bagder

	* lib/ftp.c: Fixed the FTP response reader to deal with timeouts
	  better. Previously it would reset the timeout for each incoming
	  data, which would make veeery slow responses be allowed to take
	  even more time since the timeout would only be reached if the
	  time between two received data chunks was longer than the set
	  timeout value...

2002-04-27 15:09  bagder

	* lib/ftp.c: (Curl_GetFTPResponse) moved some code to only get
	  performed when actually needed

2002-04-27 15:07  bagder

	* lib/: easy.c, hash.h, hostip.c, llist.c, llist.h: Now uses Curl_
	  as prefix for internal global symbols. curl_ should only be used
	  for "exported" globals.

2002-04-27 15:06  bagder

	* lib/hash.c: DNC cache prune crash removed, made the name spacing
	  follow the general rule: "Curl_" prefix for library-wide private
	  symbols, "curl_" is for exported symbols.

2002-04-26 14:58  bagder

	* docs/INSTALL: openbsd on Alpha was no problemos

2002-04-26 14:57  bagder

	* CHANGES: test suite portability fix

2002-04-26 09:48  bagder

	* tests/server/sws.c: handles much larger POSTs, replaced
	  snprintf() with sprintf() since this needs to be more portable
	  and in the test server we can skip the extra safety

2002-04-26 09:45  bagder

	* CHANGES: another week of changes

2002-04-25 21:26  bagder

	* lib/ftp.c: adjusted to the new Curl_resolv() proto

2002-04-25 21:18  bagder

	* lib/url.c: prevent persistant connections to do name resolves

2002-04-25 21:00  bagder

	* lib/: connect.c, ftp.c, hostip.c, hostip.h, url.c, urldata.h: In
	  order to not get problems with DNS cache pruning, we no longer
	  store any name resolved data in any curl handle struct. That way,
	  we won't mind if the cache entries are pruned for the next time
	  we need them. We'll just resolve them again instead.

	  This changes the Curl_resolv() proto. It modifies the
	  SessionHandle struct but perhaps most importantly, it'll make the
	  internals somewhat dependent on the DNS cache not being disabled
	  as that will cripple operations somewhat.  Especially for
	  persistant connections.

2002-04-25 18:45  bagder

	* docs/libcurl/curl_easy_getinfo.3: the TOTAL_TIME is not really
	  total, as it excludes the connect time...

2002-04-25 17:50  bagder

	* lib/krb4.c: use the hostname pointer instead of using IPv4-only
	  info from a struct

2002-04-24 12:16  bagder

	* docs/libcurl/curl_easy_setopt.3: clarified a bit with the
	  timecondition stuff

2002-04-24 12:16  bagder

	* docs/KNOWN_BUGS: no, this doesn't look like it bugs

2002-04-24 12:15  bagder

	* docs/INSTALL: NetBSD alpha works, also tried a newer FreeBSD on
	  alpha

2002-04-23 16:57  bagder

	* lib/url.c: removed warning about signed/unsigned comparison

2002-04-23 16:56  bagder

	* lib/hostip.c: the 80 column police narrowed this source code! B-]

2002-04-23 15:34  bagder

	* lib/url.c: fixes bug report #547484, no_proxy doesn't properly
	  strip off port numbers from the host names before comparing

2002-04-23 02:05  bagder

	* src/main.c: use new timecond defines

2002-04-23 01:56  bagder

	* lib/connect.c: allow binding the local end of a connection even
	  when using IPv6, thus we now have --interface working properly

2002-04-23 01:54  bagder

	* lib/file.c: use double where it is supposed to

2002-04-23 01:53  bagder

	* lib/hostip.c: use sclose() to close sockets

2002-04-23 01:53  bagder

	* lib/http.c: renamed the TIMECOND defines to be CURL_ prefixed

2002-04-22 15:33  bagder

	* include/curl/curl.h: The timecond stuff now have CURL_ prefixes

2002-04-22 15:31  bagder

	* lib/hostip.c: Jacky Lam's adjust resolve-buffer size patch
	  applied. Slightly edited by Daniel.

2002-04-19 13:00  bagder

	* lib/hostip.c: pack_hostent does not handle 64 bit pointers
	  correctly.  A Bjrn Reese patch.

2002-04-17 22:13  bumblebury

	* lib/: hash.c, hash.h, hostip.c: Prune old hostcache entries with
	  each call...	This can be optimized a tidbit, but this is a
	  start.

2002-04-17 09:21  bagder

	* docs/libcurl/curl_easy_getinfo.3: Dirk Manske's two new infos

2002-04-17 09:16  bagder

	* lib/transfer.c: Dirk Manske's fix for HTTP response code 301,
	  that now behaves more like browsers do. Which thus *breaks* the
	  RFC 2616...

2002-04-16 09:59  bagder

	* CHANGES, include/curl/curl.h, lib/getinfo.c, lib/progress.c,
	  lib/progress.h, lib/transfer.c, lib/urldata.h: Dirk Manske
	  brought the patch that introduces two new CURLINFO_* values:
	  CURLINFO_REDIRECT_TIME and CURLINFO_REDIRECT_COUNT.

2002-04-15 15:47  bagder

	* lib/transfer.c: Jonatan Lander fixed the "Disables POST, goes
	  with GET" output to be more connected with reality! ;-)

2002-04-15 13:19  bagder

	* lib/: formdata.c, formdata.h, http.c: This makes formposting with
	  a specified file missing fail. curl_easy_perform will then return
	  CURLE_READ_ERROR.

2002-04-15 08:58  bagder

	* CHANGES, include/curl/curl.h, src/version.h: 7.9.6 commit

2002-04-14 20:21  bagder

	  from the beginning of cookie contents.

2002-04-14 19:29  bagder

	* include/curl/curl.h: check for _MSC_VER as well as __STDC__ when
	  deciding to use the ## operator or not

2002-04-14 09:33  bagder

	* lib/ftp.c: removed unused variable

	  protocol-specific connect actions)

2002-04-12 09:53  bagder

	* lib/http.c: the HTTP request is a CURLINFO_HEADER_OUT

	* docs/libcurl/libcurl-errors.3: corrected to new return codes

2002-04-10 16:20  bagder

2002-04-10 16:07  bagder

	* lib/url.c: default proxy port set, as reported by Sebastien
	  Willemijns

	  pre-ISO compilers (without the ## operator)

2002-04-04 08:07  bagder

	  OSF1/Tru64) Gerhard Herre reported this in bug report #536238

2002-04-03 13:11  bagder

	* lib/formdata.c: Tor Arntsen's fix for "CGI_Lite" compliance!

	  regular curl/curl.h now

2002-03-20 11:53  bagder

	* lib/transfer.c: crlf replacement on uploads did not work. test
	  case 128 was added just now to make sure it remains functional.

2002-03-20 11:52  bagder

	* lib/ftp.c: verbose FTP PASV output could output a "random" name
	  from the stack based array Also, uploading data with --crlf
	  cannot check that the proper size was uploaded and thus should
	  not warn if the sizes differ. This can be changed in the future
	  by having the expected size in the connectdata struct and then
	  increase the expected size for each byte that is added in the
	  --crlf replacement process.

2002-03-20 11:50  bagder

	  warnings

2002-03-18 23:26  bagder

	* tests/data/: Makefile.am, test32: test 32, try -d and -G

2002-03-18 23:21  bagder

	* src/main.c: reverted 1.109, we can't set the request type when -d
	  is used, as -G can be used and it makes it a GET...

2002-03-18 09:53  bagder

	* docs/libcurl/curl_easy_setopt.3: WRITEFUNCTION correction

2002-03-18 09:52  bagder

	  write callback returned an error, even if we were decoding a
	  chunked-encoded transfer

2002-03-15 10:54  bagder

	* lib/hostip.c: Jun-ichiro itojun Hagino <itojun@itojun.org>:

	  Now first check if IPv6 is supported, then use PF_UNSPEC. If not,
	  use PF_INET.	It'll solve both the "slow name lookup" problem on
	  IPv4 and still work fine on IPv6 hosts.

	  Bug report #530204 has more details:
	  http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&atid=100976&aid=530204&group_id=976

2002-03-15 09:45  bagder

	* lib/hostip.c: bug report #530204 correctly identified that
	  revision 1.52 broke ipv6 functionality and this change reverts
	  this.

	  However, with this revert we bring back problems on (some/all?)
	  non-IPv6 enabled Linux machines that have getaddrinfo().

2002-03-14 15:53  bagder

	* docs/examples/: Makefile.am, post-callback.c: new example for
	  libcurl 7.9.6 or later

2002-03-14 15:39  bagder

	* lib/http.c: if CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS isn't set, but CURLOPT_POST is,
	  we will assume that we should read the POST-data from the read
	  callback

2002-03-14 15:37  bagder

	* lib/transfer.c: 2002

2002-03-14 15:37  bagder

	* lib/url.c: CURLOPT_POST deserved a new comment with the new
	  POST-by-callback support

2002-03-13 14:13  bagder

	* lib/ftp.c: no longer attempts to SIZE a NULL pointer, as that
	  wasn't very clever (but didn't crash or anything)

2002-03-13 14:10  bagder

	* lib/url.c: Setting CURLOPT_PASSWDFUNCTION to NULL now restores
	  the internal function.

2002-03-13 14:09  bagder

	* lib/sendf.c: sendf() now deals with Curl_write() returning -1
	  properly, which it might do if the write would've blocked

2002-03-13 13:10  bagder

	* lib/formdata.c: now supports all options in arrays, except the
	  CURLFORM_ARRAY itself

2002-03-13 13:09  bagder

	* include/curl/curl.h: CURLFORM_ARRAYSTART and ARRAYEND are now

	  features

2002-03-11 16:20  bagder

	* src/main.c: now -F supports 'filename=blabla' for parts that
	  upload a file, to set the filename field of that part. A typical
	  example line could look like:

	  -F 'name=@filename;filename=/dev/null'

	  This can be combined with type= too, in a manner similar to:

	  -F "file=@log/test39.txt;filename=fakerfile;type=moo/foobar"

	  Enjoy.

2002-03-11 16:18  bagder

	* lib/: formdata.c, formdata.h: Added support for CURLFORM_FILENAME
	  to set the filename field of a file part.

2002-03-11 16:14  bagder

	* include/curl/curl.h: CURLFORM_FILENAME added and some cleanups,

	* lib/memdebug.c: detect fclose(NULL)

2002-03-08 16:18  bagder

	* src/main.c: better treatment of the config->errors, only fclose()
	  this if it was truly fopen()ed. It could end up fclose()ing a
	  NULL as discovered by Clifford Wolf.

2002-03-08 16:06  bagder

	* lib/url.c: Jean-Philippe Barrette-LaPierre fixed the
	  CURLOPT_PASSWDFUNCTION to make NULL set back the internal default
	  function

2002-03-08 13:05  bagder

	* src/main.c: closes bug report #527032, --progress-bar works again

2002-02-28 13:37  bagder

	  jar

2002-02-27 08:38  bagder

2002-02-26 14:18  bagder

	  formatted cookies and cookiejar storage"

	  discards silly input

2002-02-26 08:59  bagder

	* include/curl/curl.h, src/version.h: 7.9.5-pre4 commit

2002-02-25 16:25  bagder

	  2002 12:11 MET. with the new http server on Linux

	* tests/server/sws.c: support HUGE requests too

2002-02-25 10:08  bagder

2002-02-25 09:20  bagder

	  it, why we need to make a different and more complicated check
	  for when to include it

2002-02-25 08:40  bagder

	* docs/curl.1, src/writeout.c: "Yet Another Geek" made

	* tests/server/Makefile: use -W too

2002-02-22 11:51  bagder

	* tests/data/test3: fixed to work with 'nonewline' and thus this
	  passes OK with the new http server and things

2002-02-22 11:50  bagder

	* tests/: FILEFORMAT, runtests.pl: support for using protocol
	  without a trailing newline

	  src/version.h: Nico Baggus' VMS tweaks

2002-02-20 14:38  bagder

	* lib/transfer.c: Andrs Garca solved bug report #515228 by making
	  sure the progress meter is updated even if everything is read in
	  one single pass, as the windows functions apparantly does more
	  often than other systems.

2002-02-19 12:02  bagder

	* lib/multi.h: corrected reference to multi-using examples

2002-02-19 12:00  bagder

2002-02-19 00:17  bagder

	* docs/TODO: auth on multiple hosts with follow-location

2002-02-19 00:12  bagder

	* lib/hostip.c: Rick Richardson's getaddrinfo() usage fix to speed
	  up name resolves

2002-02-18 23:59  bagder

	* lib/hostip.c: INADDR_NONE should be in_addr_t to work with 64bit
	  archs better.

	  Bug report #517687

2002-02-17 15:42  bagder

2002-02-07 10:32  bagder

	* Makefile.dist: Miklos Nemeth windows update

2002-02-06 17:03  bagder

2002-02-06 17:00  bagder

	* lib/Makefile.vc6: Miklos Nemeth improved

2002-02-06 16:48  bagder

	* lib/formdata.c: ARGH the CRLF I removed recently was not only
	  done after the initial content-type header, it was used for each
	  part and thus without this it failed MISERABLY. *smacks forhead*

2002-02-06 10:49  bagder

	* docs/curl_easy_setopt.3: a few of the SSL options were added in
	  7.9.3 and it should be noted accordingly

2002-02-06 08:02  bagder

	* lib/transfer.c: Brent Beardsley found the content-type bug!

2002-02-05 16:33  bagder

2002-01-31 08:53  bagder

	* acinclude.m4: Albert Chin: Forgot one case. On HP-UX 11.00,
	  gethostbyname_r() is properly defined if -D_REENTRANT is used.
	  Without it, the compiler still accepts the function prototype but
	  gives a warning about hostent_data going out of scope. This is
	  because struct hostent_data is not declared. So, we force an
	  error by trying to set a variable to the struct.

2002-01-31 08:51  bagder

	* lib/hostip.c: _num_chars did wrong when called with a number that

	  actually the fix I did on my test machine! :-)

2002-01-30 16:35  bagder

	* docs/libcurl-the-guide: I have too many ideas of what to mention
	  in this docs

2002-01-30 16:11  bagder

	* lib/sendf.c: Georg Horn found yet another SSL reading problem
	  caused by the non-blocks.  This was a real bummer!

2002-01-30 11:18  bagder

	* tests/runtests.pl: big-time alert that this doesn't work

2002-01-30 11:07  bagder

	* docs/libcurl-the-guide: the interface is simply called the "C"
	  one these days

2002-01-30 11:04  bagder

	* docs/libcurl-the-guide: extended the proxy chapter mucho

2002-01-30 09:17  bagder

	  random file or egd socket is given

2002-01-29 21:34  bagder

	* lib/url.c: conn->upload_bufsize exists no more

2002-01-29 21:32  bagder

	* lib/http.c: append a CRLF pair after the content-type line

2002-01-29 21:30  bagder

	* lib/formdata.c: removed three loust fprintf()s removed the
	  initial CRLF in the formpost, as they are part of the request and
	  should be written by the code in http.c!

2002-01-29 21:28  bagder

	* lib/transfer.c: upload progress counter fix, removed the
	  adjustable upload buffer size

2002-01-29 21:28  bagder

	* lib/urldata.h: no more adjustable upload buffer size, we use
	  non-blocking sockets now so this work-around is not needed
	  anymore!

2002-01-29 15:12  bagder

	* CHANGES: nine items since 7.9.3

2002-01-29 15:11  bagder

	* lib/ssluse.c: - T. Bharath pointed out that we seed SSL on every
	  connect, which is a time-   consuming operation that should only
	  be needed to do once. We patched   libcurl to now only seed on
	  the first connect when unseeded. The seeded	status is global so
	  it'll now only happen once during a program's life time.

2002-01-29 11:55  bagder

	* tests/data/test1: bad tag

2002-01-29 11:49  bagder

	  lib/urldata.h: Giaslas Georgios introduced CURLINFO_CONTENT_TYPE

2002-01-28 20:31  bagder

	* lib/url.c: Steve Marx helped us realize that we shouldn't treat
	  customrequest as a request of its own, it just changes the
	  keyword of a request.

2002-01-28 20:23  bagder

	* lib/hostip.c: someone should have me punished, but this bug made
	  curl bug seriously on IPv4-linux machines

2002-01-28 20:22  bagder

	* src/main.c: don't count a custom request as a request type of its
	  own, it is merely a modifier of another type

2002-01-28 19:39  bagder

	* lib/getdate.c: newly generated

2002-01-28 19:39  bagder

	* lib/getdate.y: Andreas Damm made it reentrant safe!

2002-01-27 12:51  bagder

	* lib/http.c: no longer add CRLF _after_ POST data, it should not
	  be needed. Pedro Neves pointed out this ugliness.

2002-01-27 12:49  bagder

	* lib/getinfo.c: set header and request size to 0 before each
	  *_perform()

2002-01-25 11:07  bagder

	* docs/examples/: Makefile.am, postit.c: postit.c is removed, it
	  used the deprecated curl_formparse() and may encourage people to
	  use bad functions

2002-01-25 09:35  bagder

	* lib/transfer.c: bug report #508235 identified a non-working
	  Location: following, and this little fix seems to correct it.
	  another case where we just returned and didn't shut off the
	  reading. This bug is introduced in 7.9.3 due to the new internal
	  "order".

	* lib/transfer.c: Andrs Garca found out that we didn't properly
	  stop reading from a connection after the headers on a HEAD
	  request. This bug has been added in 7.9.3 and was mnot present
	  earlier.

2002-01-22 14:41  bagder

	* docs/libcurl-the-guide: more about passwords and started about

	* include/curl/curl.h, lib/ftp.c, lib/netrc.c: #if [undefined] =>
	  #ifdef [undefined]

2002-01-18 14:00  bagder

	* configure.in: playing with more strict gcc warnings with
	  --enable-debug

2002-01-18 13:59  bagder

	* lib/hostip.c: prevents gcc -Wcast-align from complaining

2002-01-18 13:56  bagder

	* lib/ftp.c: made gcc -Wcast-align happy

2002-01-18 13:53  bagder

	* lib/mprintf.c: #ifndef and #define magic to prevent compiler
	  warnings when doing #if BLA where BLA is undefined

2002-01-18 13:48  bagder

	* docs/TODO: updated to 2002 status ;-)

2002-01-18 11:45  bagder

	* lib/mprintf.c: cut off a big piece of comment and added a pointer
	  to the Trio web page should anyone ever want a good printf()
	  clone

2002-01-18 11:43  bagder

	* configure.in: commented out the 'long long' and 'long double'
	  checks, as we don't really use them anyway and they cause
	  warnings in lib/mprint.c

2002-01-18 11:36  bagder

	* lib/hash.c: I wish I could type. Anyway, this proved it is a good
	  habit to put the NULL on the left side of comparisons...

2002-01-18 11:30  bagder

	* lib/: hash.c, llist.c: added typecast for a malloc() return, and
	  added check for NULL

2002-01-18 10:25  bagder

	* lib/sendf.c: Added #include <errno.h>

2002-01-18 09:03  bagder

	* lib/sendf.c: Andrs Garca patched. It now checks for EWOULDBLOCK
	  properly on windows boxes.

2002-01-18 09:03  bagder

	* lib/Makefile.m32: patched by Andrs Garca

2002-01-17 15:34  bagder

	* include/curl/curl.h, src/version.h: 7.9.3-pre3

2002-01-17 15:25  bagder

	* CHANGES: correct ssl version, fixed ssl writes, solved time-out
	  disconnect without text, fixed dns cache problem, made it compile
	  with openssl before 0.9.5 again and extended libcurl-the-guide a
	  bit more

2002-01-17 15:24  bagder

	* docs/libcurl-the-guide: more text added

2002-01-17 14:45  bagder

	* docs/examples/simplessl.c: added a comment about this example
	  only works with 7.9.3 and newer libs

2002-01-17 11:40  bagder

	* lib/ssluse.c: Richard Archer made it compile and build with
	  OpenSSL versions prior to 0.9.5

2002-01-17 09:03  bagder

	* lib/hostip.c: include our own sprintf() prototype to make it
	  return sensible data on all platforms, I also edited a few data
	  types slightly to prevent my compiler from warning on
	  comparisions between signed and unsigned values

2002-01-17 08:38  bumblebury

	* lib/hostip.c: Get this working, still need to check for leaks and
	  such, but should be fine..

2002-01-17 07:55  bumblebury

	* lib/hostip.c: Make the keys for hostcache entries be in the
	  format:: host:port, so accessing curl.haxx.se on port 80 would
	  yield a key value of :: curl.haxx.se:80

2002-01-17 01:27  bagder

	* docs/libcurl-the-guide: filled-in text in the "Building" chapter
	  and added a "libcurl with C++" chapter

2002-01-17 00:28  bagder

	* lib/sendf.c: SSL writes passed back a silly length...

2002-01-16 23:26  bagder

	* lib/connect.c: fixed time-out returned without error text set

2002-01-16 18:45  bagder

	* lib/version.c: Kevin Roth's SSLeay() patch, slight edited by me.
	  Works with OpenSSL 0.9.5 now.

2002-01-16 16:12  bagder

	* include/curl/curl.h, src/version.h: 7.9.3-pre2

2002-01-16 16:04  bagder

	* CHANGES: --cc and working non-blocking sockets uploads

2002-01-16 15:53  bagder

	* lib/urldata.h: - shrunk the BUFSIZE define from 50K to 20K - made
	  a separate buffer for uploads (due to the non-blocking stuff) -
	  added two connectdata struct fields for non-blocking uploads

2002-01-16 15:50  bagder

	* lib/transfer.c: modified to deal with the new non-blocking
	  versions of Curl_read() and Curl_write().

2002-01-16 15:49  bagder

	* lib/sendf.h: Curl_write's 5th argument now is signed

2002-01-16 15:49  bagder

	* lib/sendf.c: Curl_read() and Curl_write() are both now adjusted
	  to return properly in cases where EWOULDBLOCK or equivalent is
	  returned. We must not block.

2002-01-16 15:47  bagder

	* lib/telnet.c: Curl_write() now takes a different 5th argument

2002-01-16 15:47  bagder

	* lib/http.c: Somewhat ugly fix to deal with non-blocking sockets.
	  We just loop and try again. THIS IS NOT A NICE FIX.

2002-01-16 15:46  bagder

	* lib/ftp.c: Somewhat ugly fix to deal with non-blocking sockets.
	  We just loop and try again. THIS IS NOT A NICE FIX. We
	  should/must make a select() then and only retry when we can write
	  to the socket again.

2002-01-16 15:20  bagder

	* curl-config.in: added support for --cc to output the compiler
	  name. This makes it possible to compile libcurl stuff without any
	  prior knowledge:

	  cc=`curl-config --cc` cflags=`curl-config --cflags`
	  libs=`curl-config --libs`

	  $cc $flags $libs -o example example.c

	  Or if you prefer, the oh-so-cool single-line version:

	  `curl-config --cc --cflags --libs` -o example example.c

2002-01-16 15:13  bagder

	* docs/examples/README: added a somewhat cool single-line command
	  that builds most example sources on unix-like systems

2002-01-15 09:22  bagder

	* docs/libcurl-the-guide: initial attempt to write a tutorial-like
	  libcurl guide

2002-01-15 00:32  bagder

	* CHANGES: fixed non-blocking reads, fixed ssl sessions, in_addr_t
	  and more non-blocking

2002-01-15 00:14  bagder

	* lib/: ftp.c, http.c, sendf.c, sendf.h, telnet.c, transfer.c:
	  Curl_read() now returns a negative return code if EWOULDBLOCK or
	  similar

2002-01-15 00:14  bagder

	* lib/hostip.c: a memory leak when name lookup failed is now
	  removed

2002-01-14 08:53  bagder

	* acinclude.m4: Stoned Elipot's patch for the in_addr_t test

2002-01-14 06:36  bumblebury

	* lib/hash.h: Remove erreaneous include, setup.h is included one
	  line above

2002-01-13 12:32  bagder

	* docs/examples/simplessl.c: Gtz Babin-Ebell updated with some new
	  7.9.3 features

2002-01-13 12:32  bagder

	* docs/curl_easy_setopt.3: Gtz Babin-Ebell provided some
	  documantation for the ENGINE stuff

2002-01-10 10:00  bagder

	* docs/examples/: Makefile.am, http-post.c: added http-post.c

2002-01-10 08:38  bagder

	* docs/BUGS: slightly extended to mention that -v and -i are good
	  options to use when reporting bugs

2002-01-09 14:23  bagder

	* docs/examples/simple.c: bad comment begone

2002-01-09 14:22  bagder

	* docs/examples/simple.c: cut off argc and argv as well

2002-01-09 14:22  bagder

	* docs/examples/simple.c: Cleaned up this example to make it even
	  simpler.

2002-01-09 10:38  bagder

	* lib/ssluse.c: Cris Bailiff found out that when the SSL session
	  cache was filled, libcurl would crash. This corrects the problem.

2002-01-09 00:27  bagder

	* docs/INSTALL: David Bentham's updated QNX notification

2002-01-09 00:23  bagder

	* lib/ssluse.c: added a missing failf() before returning an error
	  code

2002-01-09 00:19  bagder

	* lib/sendf.c: this seems to correct the SSL reading problem
	  introduced when switching over to non-blocking sockets, but this
	  loops very nastily. We should return back to the select() and
	  wait there until more data arrives, not just blindly attempt
	  again and again...

2002-01-08 14:05  bagder

	* docs/examples/ftpget.c: I made the write callback create the file
	  the first time it gets called so that it won't create an empty
	  file if the remote file doesn't exist

2002-01-08 10:32  bagder

	* tests/runtests.pl: test case 38 added a few new requirements

2002-01-08 10:32  bagder

	* tests/FILEFORMAT: updated

2002-01-08 10:32  bagder

	* tests/getpart.pm: added some tracability

2002-01-08 10:31  bagder

	* tests/data/: Makefile.am, test38: test case 38, try a HTTP
	  download resume without the server supporting ranges

2002-01-08 09:26  bagder

	* docs/examples/Makefile.am: another example source added

2002-01-08 09:25  bagder

	* docs/examples/ftpgetresp.c, include/curl/curl.h, src/version.h:
	  7.9.3 pre-release commit

2002-01-08 08:22  bagder

	* CHANGES: non-blocking sockets, DNS caching updated, cookies
	  corrected, bool is now unsigned everywhere

2002-01-08 08:06  bagder

	* lib/hostip.c: added two typecasts to prevent compiler (gcc3)
	  warnings

2002-01-08 05:30  bumblebury

	* lib/: hostip.c, urldata.h: 1) the dns_cache_timeout should be an
	  integer, not a bool 2) in the curl_dns_cache_entry structure,
	  timestamp should be a time_t instead of an integer (although I
	  doubt it matters).

2002-01-08 05:26  bumblebury

	* include/curl/curl.h, lib/hostip.c, lib/url.c, lib/urldata.h: Add
	  support for DNS cache timeouts via the CURLOPT_DNS_CACHE_TIMEOUT
	  option.

	  The default cache timeout for this is 60 seconds, which is
	  arbitrary and completely subject to change :)

2002-01-08 00:05  bagder

	* lib/cookie.c: As identified in bug report #495290, the last
	  "name=value" pair in a Set-Cookie: line was ignored if they
	  didn't end with a trailing semicolon. This is indeed wrong
	  syntax, but there are high-profile web sites out there sending
	  cookies like that so we must make a best-effort to parse them.

2002-01-07 23:47  bagder

	* lib/setup.h: the bool typedef is now made unsigned, to make sure
	  it stays that on all platforms, unrelated to what they might
	  prefer by default

2002-01-07 23:46  bagder

	* lib/transfer.c: removed silly check for >=0 of a supposedly
	  unsigned value!

2002-01-07 21:55  bumblebury

	* lib/hostip.c: Probably not necessary, but good practice.

2002-01-07 21:52  bumblebury

	* include/curl/curl.h, lib/easy.c, lib/hash.c, lib/hash.h,
	  lib/hostip.c, lib/hostip.h, lib/multi.c, lib/url.c,
	  lib/urldata.h: Make cach'ing work with threads now, there are now
	  three cases:

	      - Use a global dns cache (via setting the tentatively named,
	      CURLOPT_DNS_USE_GLOBAL_CACHE option to true)
	      - Use a per-handle dns cache, by default
	      - Use a pooled dns cache when in the "multi" interface

2002-01-07 19:38  bagder

	* lib/: connect.c, ssluse.c: Modified to use non-blocking sockets
	  all the time.

2002-01-07 17:03  bagder

	* CHANGES: VC++ makefile, HTTP 204, cookie fix, non-blocking socket
	  for better SSL connection timeout

2002-01-07 16:24  bagder

	* lib/transfer.c: added proper breaks in the switch()

2002-01-07 16:14  bagder

	* docs/INSTALL: Added David Bentham's notes about QNX and
	  FD_SETSIZE

2002-01-07 15:57  bagder

	* lib/transfer.c: HTTP response 204 should be treated similar to
	  304, that is we must not expect (nor read) any response-body

2002-01-07 15:56  bagder

	* lib/cookie.c: added precautions to not go insane when two
	  matching cookies end up in the cookie list, even though they're
	  not supposed to do that...

2002-01-05 00:48  subman

	* lib/curllib.dsp: Add hash and llist to VC dsp file

2002-01-05 00:47  subman

	* lib/Makefile.vc6: Add hash and llist to VC makefile

2002-01-04 14:20  bagder

	* tests/runtests.pl: -l lists all tests

2002-01-04 14:15  bagder

	* docs/MANUAL: The former -c is "-C -" these days

2002-01-04 10:57  bagder

	* CHANGES: dns cache, ftp response read, 64bit fixes, printf
	  replaces, inet_ntoa_r corrections

2002-01-04 10:53  bagder

	* lib/telnet.c: replaced printf() => Curl_sendf()

2002-01-04 10:53  bagder

	* lib/getenv.c: removed a commented line

2002-01-04 10:52  bagder

	* lib/krb4.c: fixed an inet_ntoa() occurance to use inet_ntoa_r()
	  if it is available.  I also replaced all printf() calls with
	  calls to Curl_failf()

2002-01-04 10:38  bagder

	* lib/url.c: an unconditional occurance of inet_ntoa() now uses
	  inet_ntoa_r() on all platforms that have such a function.  This
	  affects multi-thread running libcurls on IPv4 systems that have
	  VERBOSE switched on. The previous version was risking that
	  another thread overwrote the data before it was read out in this
	  thread. There could possibly also be a slight risk that the data
	  isn't zero terminated for a short while and thus could cause the
	  thread to crash...

2002-01-04 10:35  bagder

	* lib/ftp.c: #include the local "inet_ntoa_r.h" file if no proto
	  was found in the global header directory but the function *is*
	  present!

2002-01-04 10:17  bagder

	* lib/ftp.c: The buffer in ftp_pasv_verbose(), used for
	  gethostbyaddr_r(), is now defined to become properly 8-byte
	  aligned on 64-bit archs. Philip Gladstone reported.

2002-01-04 10:03  bagder

	* lib/ftp.c: The FTP response lines are now passed to the function
	  callback registered for headers.

2002-01-03 16:03  bagder

	* Makefile.am, configure.in: multi stuff from the multi-dev branch

2002-01-03 16:01  bagder

	* lib/: Makefile.am, multi.c, multi.h, transfer.c, transfer.h,
	  url.c, url.h, urldata.h: merged the multi-dev branch back into
	  MAIN again

2002-01-03 11:22  bagder

	* lib/: Makefile.am, connect.c, easy.c, ftp.c, hash.c, hash.h,
	  hostip.c, hostip.h, llist.c, llist.h, url.c: Sterling Hughes'
	  provided initial DNS cache source code.

2002-01-03 10:43  bagder

	* CHANGES, docs/curl.1, lib/urldata.h: minor changes

2002-01-03 10:12  bagder

	* CVS-INFO: added required software and Guido Neitzer's Mac OS X
	  build instructions

2002-01-03 09:22  bagder

	* tests/runtests.pl: added a little percentage for "ok coverage"

2002-01-03 09:07  bagder

	* src/main.c: Changed how -I/--head works when --include is also
	  used... Test case 104 stopped working after the dec-20 fixes that
	  now supports FTP operations to skip the transfer phase.

2002-01-03 08:23  bagder

	* CHANGES: Philip Gladstone's fixes

2002-01-03 01:51  bagder

	* lib/ftp.c: pass an 'int' as the third argument to bind()

2002-01-03 00:22  bagder

	* lib/transfer.c: don't fail on partly downloaded content if we
	  follow a "new URL" due to the follow-location logic

2002-01-02 18:42  bagder

	* lib/urldata.h: incorporated the 1.93 => 1.94 change into this
	  branch too

2002-01-02 11:06  bagder

	* lib/: connect.c, ftp.c, hostip.c: Philip Gladstone's 64-bit sparc
	  native compiler compatibility issues fixed.

2001-12-21 10:55  bagder

	* CHANGES.0: the changes from 1999 is now in CHANGES.1999

2001-12-21 10:54  bagder

	* CHANGES.1999: moved the changes from 1999 into its own file

2001-12-21 10:20  bagder

	* docs/FAQ: rewrote 3.9 to be more generic with more languages:
	  "3.9 How do I use curl in my favourite programming language?"

2001-12-21 09:10  bagder

	* docs/FAQ: spell

2001-12-21 09:02  bagder

	* CHANGES: recent fixes

2001-12-20 16:58  bagder

	* lib/url.c: *cool* fix by Bjrn Stenberg, makes proxy transfers
	  work better...! :-)

2001-12-20 12:22  bagder

	* lib/: ftp.c, urldata.h: If nobody is set we won't download any
	  FTP file. If include_header is set, we return a set of headers
	  not more. This enables FTP operations that don't transfer any
	  data, only perform FTP commands.

2001-12-20 00:25  bagder

	* docs/FAQ: Added 4.5.6 "301 Moved Permanently", as a reply to bug
	  report #495215

2001-12-18 15:52  bagder

	* lib/: multi.c, multi.h: edits

2001-12-18 15:43  bagder

	* lib/: multi.c, transfer.c, transfer.h, urldata.h: More tweaks.
	  Yay! We managed to actually download data with the new interace
	  now! Still a long way to go...

2001-12-18 11:13  bagder

	* docs/examples/: Makefile.am, simplessl.c: Gtz Babin-Ebell's
	  contributed "simplessl.c" example source code

2001-12-18 02:00  bagder

	* buildconf: run automake last

2001-12-18 00:43  bagder

	* Makefile.am, configure.in, lib/multi.c, lib/transfer.c,
	  lib/transfer.h, lib/urldata.h: things are moving

2001-12-18 00:10  bagder

	* lib/transfer.c: Major hack in Transfer(). I moved *ALL* local
	  local variables (with only a few exceptions) into a struct
	  instead, as that'll make it easier to store state between
	  invokes. Parts of this function will be moved out into functions
	  that are supposed to support getting invoked multiple times
	  instead of dealing with it all in one huge loop like today...

2001-12-18 00:01  bagder

	* CHANGES, configure.in, docs/THANKS, include/curl/curl.h,
	  lib/memdebug.h, lib/setup.h, lib/ssluse.c, lib/url.c,
	  lib/urldata.h, src/main.c, src/setup.h: Gtz Babin-Ebell's
	  OpenSSL ENGINE patch

2001-12-17 11:32  bagder

	* docs/TODO: strip trailing CRs

2001-12-17 10:33  bagder

	* docs/curl_formparse.3: cut off the description to prevent people
	  from using this!

2001-12-16 13:54  bagder

	* docs/curl_formadd.3: Marcus Webster's added
	  CURLFORM_CONTENTHEADER docs

2001-12-14 13:59  bagder

	* CHANGES, docs/THANKS, include/curl/curl.h, lib/formdata.c,
	  lib/formdata.h: Marcus Webster's newly added
	  CURLFORM_CONTENTHEADER

2001-12-13 13:59  bagder

	* lib/: transfer.c, transfer.h, url.c, url.h, urldata.h: moved
	  around functions, split some functions to be better fitted for
	  the multi interface

2001-12-13 13:58  bagder

	* lib/: multi.c, multi.h: one step further

2001-12-13 13:58  bagder

	* lib/Makefile.am: added the multi.[ch] files

2001-12-13 13:55  bagder

	* lib/multi-app.c: moved this to ../multi/app.c

2001-12-13 08:34  bagder

	* lib/multi-app.c: This file is added here for documentational
	  purposes only. It shows how an application could use the
	  multi-interface.

	  This file is targeted for removal later. It should become an
	  example source code in the docs directory instead!

2001-12-13 08:16  bagder

	* lib/: multi.c, multi.h: minor changes

2001-12-11 16:08  bagder

	* lib/sendf.c: solaris 2.5.1 needs the sys/types.h file before the
	  sys/socket.h

2001-12-11 14:13  bagder

	* lib/: connect.c, dict.c, ftp.c, http.c, krb4.c, security.c,
	  sendf.c, ssluse.c: failf() calls should not have newlines in the
	  message string!

2001-12-11 01:48  bagder

	* src/main.c: when the file name given to -T is used to build an
	  upload path, the local directory part is now stripped off and
	  only the actual file name part will be used

2001-12-10 12:59  bagder

	* docs/curl.1: HTTP_PROXY => http_proxy as Bjrn pointed out

2001-12-10 08:46  bagder

	* docs/curl_easy_setopt.3: corrected the READFUNCTION docs slightly

2001-12-07 16:56  bagder

	* lib/http.c: corrected the comment above gmtime_r

2001-12-07 16:51  bagder

	* configure.in, lib/http.c: added gmtime_r check

2001-12-07 10:24  crisb

	* perl/README: Updated location information for Curl_easy

2001-12-06 15:40  bagder

	* docs/TODO: Jason Mancini's -Oalways suggestion

	  we must assign set.upload to FALSE or else we might still get an
	  upload if the previous operation was an upload!

2001-12-04 17:33  bagder

	* src/macos/curl.mcp.xml.sit.hqx: Eric-update

	* CHANGES: the happy events so far today

2001-12-03 14:48  bagder

	* lib/: ftp.c, urldata.h: As Eric Lavigne pointed out, the ftp
	  response reader MUST cache data that is not dealt with when we
	  find an end-of-response line, as there might be important stuff
	  even after the correct line. So on subsequent invokes, the cached
	  data must be used!

2001-12-03 14:46  bagder

	* tests/: ftpserver.pl, data/Makefile.am, data/test126: test case
	  126 added, this uses RETRWEIRDO that makes the FTP server send
	  two responses at once, to excerise the part of curl to make sure
	  it can cache (parts of) responses properly.

2001-12-03 13:57  bagder

	  test190 as it has to be last among the FTP tests because of some
	  problems in the test server :-/

2001-11-29 20:58  bagder

	* tests/data/: Makefile.am, test127: test 127 --disable-epsv

2001-11-29 00:20  bagder

	* lib/: ftp.c, url.c, urldata.h: CURLOPT_FTP_USE_EPSV can now be

2001-11-28 14:07  bagder

	* tests/: ftpserver.pl, data/test100, data/test102: EPSV and SIZE
	  adjustments

2001-11-28 14:05  bagder

	* lib/ftp.c: Added EPSV which is now unconditionally always tried
	  before PASV, which makes it work reaaaaly nicely on IPv6-enabled
	  hosts! Added SIZE before RETR is made, always done on downloads.
	  It makes us know the size prior to download much more frequently.
	  Unfortunately, this breaks all the FTP test cases. *fixfixfix*

2001-11-28 13:16  bagder

	* lib/ftp.c: use in_addr_t for inet_addr() return code. Now, now
	  portable is this *REALLY*? We should add some configure tests for
	  this!

2001-11-28 12:09  bagder

	* lib/: multi.c, multi.h: used in the new multi interface, not yet

2001-11-13 08:20  bagder

	* docs/curl_global_init.3: point out that calling this function
	  more than once is a sever error

2001-11-12 23:27  bagder

	* lib/ftp.c: make sure to "read out" the server reply even if we
	  didn't get any data from the server when that's the only error

2001-11-12 23:10  bagder

	* lib/timeval.c: made Curl_tvdiff round the diff better and make
	  the subtraction before the multiply to not wrap-around

2001-11-12 15:15  bagder

	* CHANGES: post-weekend fixes

2001-11-12 15:08  bagder

	* lib/: getenv.c, mprintf.c: include setup.h

2001-11-12 10:47  bagder

	  **lot** of testing!!!

2001-11-12 09:50  bagder

	* lib/progress.c: We need at least one millisecond to calculate
	  current speed with! I also made the getinfo() stuff divide with
	  1000.0 now to enforce floating point since Paul Harrington claims
	  the 7.9.1 still uses even second resolution in the timers there

2001-11-08 16:06  bagder

	* lib/formdata.c: Marcus Webster reported and fixed this
	  read-one-byte-too-many problem...

2001-11-08 15:48  bagder

	* acinclude.m4: now we make sure that NULL is defined in the
	  gethostbyname_r() compiles as it turned out they aren't
	  everywhere, and that causes compiles to fail and then we don't
	  find the proper function call!

2001-11-08 13:36  bagder

	* docs/curl.1: Added two missing return codes...

2001-11-08 13:16  bagder

	* CHANGES: the proof I did something yesterday as well

2001-11-07 15:13  bagder

	* lib/url.c: get the previous struct keep_sigact

2001-11-07 10:39  bagder

2001-11-06 20:37  bagder

	* CHANGES: bug report #478780 fixed, cygwin stripped on install,
	  some more details on the changes of yesterday

2001-11-06 20:33  bagder

	* lib/: setup.h, transfer.c, url.c: myalarm() is history, we now
	  use HAVE_ALARM and we now do our very best to 1 - restore the
	  previous sigaction struct as soon as we are about to shut off our
	  timeout 2 - restore the previous alarm() timeout, in case an
	  application or similar had it running before we "borrowed" it for
	  a while.

	  No, this does not fix the multi-thread problem you get with
	  alarm(). This patch should correct bug report #478780:
	  //sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&atid=100976&aid=478780&group_id=976

	  If not, please post details!

2001-11-06 09:44  bagder

	* packages/Win32/cygwin/Makefile.am: Kevin's patch to install the
	  binary stripped

2001-11-05 15:11  bagder

	* src/main.c: John Lask's fix that adds "-1/--TLSv1" support

2001-11-05 15:07  bagder

	* include/curl/curl.h: Added an CURL_SSLVERSION_* enum for SSL
	  protocol versions

2001-11-05 15:06  bagder

	* lib/ssluse.c: we can now tell ssl to use TLSv1 protocol, and we
	  now use defines instead of real integers for versions, the
	  defines are added to curl.h

2001-11-05 15:04  bagder

	* lib/ldap.c: Ramana Mokkapati did some good bug hunting, and we
	  these fixes ldap transfers should work a lot better!

2001-11-05 13:37  bagder

	* lib/timeval.h: corrected the Curl_tvnow prototype
	  (-Wstrict-prototypes found it)

2001-11-05 13:24  bagder

	* lib/ftp.h: Curl_ftpsendf() had wrong return type

2001-11-05 12:57  bagder

	  functionality for new timeout tests

	* tests/data/: Makefile.am, test126, test29, test303, test401,
	  test402: new tests

2001-11-02 23:30  bagder

	* lib/: sendf.c, transfer.c, urldata.h: failf() now only overwrites
	  the error buffer the first time it gets called for each
	  *_perform(). It makes things a lot easier, as the first one that
	  detects the error get to write the final error reason...

2001-11-02 15:23  bagder

	* CHANGES: Replaced read() and write() with recv() and send()

2001-11-02 14:16  bagder

	* docs/FAQ: libcurl can init winsock since 7.8.1

2001-11-01 14:54  bagder

	* lib/url.c: ConnectionExists() now returns FALSE immediately if it
	  finds a connection that is dead, because it can only find one
	  entry anyway and if that is dead there won't be any other entry
	  that matches

2001-11-01 13:47  bagder

	* lib/ftp.c: added comments and function headers

2001-11-01 13:18  bagder

	* CHANGES: a bunch

2001-10-31 16:14  bagder

	* lib/url.c: Removed the SocketIsDead() stuff for SSL again as it
	  doesn't work. We must rely on the new go-ahead-and-try mechanism
	  that I just added to Transfer()

2001-10-31 16:13  bagder

	* lib/transfer.c: If Curl_do() fails with CURLE_WRITE_ERROR on a

	* lib/ftp.c: major commit, now we check the return code on every
	  invoke of Curl_ftpsendf - which now is made using a macro named
	  FTPSENDF. I turned it all caps just to make it more visible that
	  it is in fact a macro.

2001-10-31 15:48  bagder

	* lib/dict.c: check return code when issuing the request

2001-10-31 15:45  bagder

	  in public before

2001-10-30 16:21  bagder

	* lib/url.c: Added an additional SSL check for a dead socket before
	  we re-use an SSL connection. The simple socket-check is not
	  enough in these cases.

2001-10-30 13:08  bagder

	* lib/cookie.c: prevent strdup()ing NULL -- Paul Harrington's
	  report

2001-10-30 09:09  bagder

	  extraspace" test

2001-10-25 10:28  bagder

	* lib/ldap.c: bug report #474568 - We need to set "no further data
	  to download" before the Curl_ldap() function returns, as
	  otherwise it'll hang on that assumed transfer.

2001-10-24 16:16  bagder

	* docs/INSTALL: added "s390 Linux" as a platform that curl was
	  compiled for, and I also sorted the list of machines

	* configure.in: added AC_PREREQ(2.50) to prevent autoconf mistakes

2001-10-23 00:15  bagder

	* src/main.c: An SGI (IRIX) compiler doesn't like indended
	  #-instructions, so they're all in column zero now!

2001-10-22 14:52  bagder

	* lib/connect.c: make sure the connect can't return OK but return a
	  NULL as addr

2001-10-22 08:39  bagder

	* include/curl/curl.h: 2000 => 2001

2001-10-22 08:35  bagder

	* Makefile.am, packages/Makefile.am: Kevin Roth's cygwin fixes

2001-10-22 08:08  bagder

	* ltmain.sh: A Kevin Roth patch. -- It's a post 1.4.2 patch that
	  will become part of libtool 1.4.3, and it's required to allow
	  "make install" to function properly on cygwin.

2001-10-19 13:59  bagder

	* include/curl/curl.h: new return code: CURLE_GOT_NOTHING

2001-10-19 13:58  bagder

	  server we return error

2001-10-19 13:57  bagder

	* lib/easy.c: curl_easy_duphandle() now properly clones the cookie
	  option - patch by T. Bharath

2001-10-19 13:56  bagder

	* tests/data/: Makefile.am, test37: added test 37

2001-10-19 08:27  bagder

	* lib/transfer.c: CURLOPT_FAILONERROR now only returns error if the
	  HTTP code is 400 or above unconditionalliy. Previously, the code
	  check was for >= 300 unless follow- location was enabled...

2001-10-17 14:33  bagder

	* lib/: hostip.c, memdebug.c: the malloc debug system only logs
	  data if the logfile FILE * is set, which makes it easier to
	  disable debug output when built with debug functions

2001-10-17 14:24  bagder

	* lib/transfer.c: call Curl_done() in Curl_perform() after
	  Transfer() was called, even it it returned an error as there
	  might be stuff in there we must free/cleanup.  This fixes the
	  memory leak Yanick Pelletier posted about 16 Oct 2001

2001-10-17 13:51  bagder

	* tests/: getpart.pm, httpserver.pl, runtests.pl: don't use
	  'strict' anymore, as it doesn't work good with the cygwin fixes
	  also, always kill/restart the HTTP server on startup if it is our
	  test server

2001-10-16 09:59  bagder

	* lib/Makefile.am: Kevin Roth's cygwin adjustment

2001-10-16 09:58  bagder

2001-10-12 14:31  bagder

	* lib/transfer.c: better check for absolute URL redirects, adjusted
	  to new Curl_tvdiff() proto

	* docs/curl_easy_setopt.3: cleanup on language, content and facts

2001-10-11 09:41  bagder

	  been supported since 7.4...

	* tests/runtests.pl: checkserver() bugged, Kevin Roth detected and
	  fixed

	  CURLOPT_HTTP_VERSION that can specify which HTTP version libcurl
	  should use in its request

2001-10-09 08:23  bagder

	* lib/url.c: ignore SIGPIPE, as that can be actually get sent when
	  we write to a socket

2001-10-08 13:07  bagder

	* tests/data/test46: updated the cookiejar comment

2001-10-08 08:56  bagder

	* lib/connect.c: hm, an unknown error from bind() when binding the
	  outgoing socket would failf("%d") without the error as
	  argument... it would always make a weird number get output

2001-10-08 08:43  bagder

	* lib/cookie.c: corrected cookie-jar comment

2001-10-05 09:30  bagder

	* docs/curl.1: using a HTTP proxy will disable some
	  protocol-specific features that non- HTTP procotols may allow

2001-10-04 15:36  bagder

	* lib/hostip.c: made sure the correct pieces of code are compiled
	  on IPv4-only hosts, and the pack_hostent() is only compiled if
	  gethostbyname_r() isn't present.

2001-10-04 15:25  bagder

	* memanalyze.pl: supports the new ADDR prefix for getaddrinfo() and
	  freeaddrinfo() tracing

2001-10-04 15:25  bagder

	* lib/: ftp.c, hostip.c, hostip.h, memdebug.h, url.c: getaddrinfo()
	  cleanups

2001-10-03 23:42  bagder

	* lib/hostip.c: Keith McGuigan's excellent fix that makes a cloned
	  copy of the hostent struct for when gethostbyname() is used so
	  that we have the memory of the struct allocated. This turns out
	  to be needed if the curl handled is passed between threads on
	  Windows and possibly other operating systems where we use that
	  function.

2001-10-03 23:28  bagder

	* build_vms.com: Nico Baggus' updated for 7.9

	* include/curl/curl.h: added new curl_formadd() stuff

2001-10-03 10:00  bagder

	* src/main.c: Georg Huettenegger's fix that makes us no longer use
	  curl_formparse() but instead entirely rely on the curl_formadd()
	  function. The former one is subject for removal in a future
	  release.

2001-10-03 09:54  bagder

	* lib/formdata.c: Georg Huettenegger's curl_formadd fixes

2001-10-02 19:18  bagder

	* lib/connect.c: praise Bjorn Reese for mastering these dusty
	  corners of socket hacking, now we check for the error state
	  before believing we are connected in IPv6 cases

2001-10-02 14:51  bagder

	* lib/url.c: added port number in informational connect message

2001-10-02 13:26  bagder

2001-10-02 01:25  bagder

	* lib/connect.c: faster bailout on timeouts

2001-10-02 00:50  bagder

	* lib/timeval.c: added comment to the tvdiff

2001-10-02 00:50  bagder

2001-10-02 00:31  bagder

	* lib/urldata.h: renamed the stupid 'hp' to 'hostaddr' which
	  actually says what it is

2001-10-01 13:35  bagder

	* lib/: ftp.c, transfer.c: removed obsoletetd myalarm() calls

2001-10-01 13:27  bagder

	* lib/url.c: moved the myalarm() usage, and now makes sure to
	  switch it off after the name resolving, as that should be the
	  *ONLY* section in libcurl that may take a while in a synchronous
	  call.

2001-10-01 13:26  bagder

	* lib/connect.h: fixed the connecthost proto: added the timeout
	  argument

2001-10-01 13:25  bagder

	* lib/connect.c: corrected the #include files

2001-10-01 10:59  bagder

	* acinclude.m4, configure.in: Added non-blocking sockets test

2001-09-28 13:04  bagder

	* lib/: getinfo.c, transfer.c, urldata.h: filetime should be -1 if
	  the remote time was unknown as 0 is actually a valid time. we now
	  store the filetime as a long to know for sure it can hold -1
	  (there exist some unsigned time_t cases)

	* lib/security.c: improved readability slightly

2001-09-28 11:19  bagder

	* lib/: krb4.c, security.c: fixed the missing getftpresponse edits

2001-09-28 11:15  bagder

	* lib/: ftp.c, ftp.h, krb4.c, security.c: removed the socket
	  argument from some functions that always passed in the same
	  socket and it was available from the passed-in struct anyway!

2001-09-28 11:02  bagder

	* lib/ftp.c: now compiles warning-free when IPv6-enabled

2001-09-28 10:58  bagder

	* lib/ftp.c: moved the PORT and PASV code into separate smaller
	  functions for readability renamed all static ^_ftp_* functions to
	  ^ftp_, prefixing with underscore is not nice

2001-09-28 09:46  bagder

	* lib/: ftp.c, hostip.c: more ipv6 cleanups to make smaller
	  functions that are easier to read

2001-09-28 09:05  bagder

	* lib/: ftp.c, hostip.c, hostip.h, url.c, urldata.h: more
	  transparant support for IPv6 name resolving

	  domain for received cookies so that we can properly match those
	  cookies in subsequent requests

2001-09-26 09:06  bagder

	* tests/data/: Makefile.am, test46: Added test 46, cookie jar
	  functionality

2001-09-26 09:05  bagder

	* tests/data/stunnel.pem: moved to parent directory

2001-09-23 14:47  bagder

	* lib/ftp.c: test 119 proved a memory leak in the FTP parts when

2001-09-23 14:46  bagder

	* tests/data/: test108, test116, test119: Adjusted to run on
	  ipv6-enabled hosts

	  that helped me nail the problem with curl not discovering with a
	  bad certificate was used.

2001-09-19 16:49  bagder

	* docs/TODO: http put with --crlf requires  chunked content
	  encoding

	  working on), I don't know if this is correct, but its a step (the
	  vim part is correct :)

	  mistakenly added ,

2001-08-24 12:25  bagder

	* lib/strtok.c: rewrite to work around BSD announcement license
	  issues, this is also somewhat easier to understand if I may say
	  so. It is slightly slower.

2001-08-24 12:18  bagder

	* tests/data/test8: cookies are stored in the reversed order now
	  (which in turn means that the order is _not_ actually reversed
	  like it used to be)

2001-08-24 09:45  bagder

	* lib/curllib.dsp: T. Bharath's patch => linking with multithreaded
	  versions of the c runtime library for use in multithreaded apps

2001-08-24 09:43  bagder

	* config-win32.h: T. Bharath's patch. It is kind of dirty, as it
	  #pragma aways a whole bunch of compiler warnings, but I guess
	  they make the life somewhat easier to live for a ms dude
	  compiling this. For a rainy day: remove the pragmas and correct
	  the source code that cause the warnings!

2001-08-24 09:41  bagder

	* lib/getdate.c: newly re-generated from the modified getdate.y

2001-08-24 09:39  bagder

	* lib/: setup.h, strequal.c: cleanups

2001-08-24 09:01  bagder

	* src/main.c: Kevin Roth's comments about -G have been addressed: o
	  -G -I works on the same command line and makes HEAD instead of
	  GET o -G with an already present question mark in the URL makes
	  an ampersand get   added as a separator instead

2001-08-24 08:31  bagder

	* lib/Makefile.vc6: Tim Costello's bug report #454856

2001-08-24 08:20  bagder

	* lib/ssluse.c: strcasecmp() is banned from our code, should be
	  strequal() everywhere! Tim Costello reported bug report #454858.

2001-08-23 16:06  bagder

	* lib/url.c: When setting *_URL or *_PROXY in *_setopt(), it is
	  important that we check and possibly free the existing pointer
	  first, and then clear the "allocated" bit. We previously
	  mistakenly could free the new pointer passed to us by the
	  friendly user...!

2001-08-23 16:05  bagder

	* lib/: cookie.c, cookie.h: started working on a function for
	  writing (all) cookies, made it possible to read multiple cookie
	  files, no longer writes to the URL string passed to the _add()
	  function. The new stuff is now conditionally compiled on the
	  COOKIE define. Changed the _init() proto.

2001-08-23 13:12  bagder

	* docs/FAQ: added FTPS to the list of supported protocols

2001-08-23 13:11  bagder

	* docs/FAQ: item 4.6 is now an indication of a crash, not a timeout

2001-08-23 13:06  bagder

	* lib/curllib.dsp: As Steve Lhomme pointed out, this generates
	  'libcurl.dll' now instead of the previous 'curl.dll'

2001-08-23 12:56  bagder

	* build_vms.com: Nico's update: "modified the build procedure to
	  restore to the right current directory where the build was
	  started and it will autosense where is was run from and set up
	  the correct default directory at start of the script."

2001-08-23 10:45  bagder

	* docs/examples/postit2.c: curl_formadd() using example, the 7.9
	  style of building rfc1867 form posts

2001-08-23 08:10  bagder

	* lib/ftp.c: I want Sterling to be my friend, so I wasted some time
	  on splitting up the huge monster function _ftp() into more little
	  functions. There are still more that can be done, but this is at
	  least improving readability and maintainability... :-)

2001-08-22 13:25  bagder

	* CHANGES: Georg Huettenegger's fixes, man pages converted to HTML
	  pages and included in release archive

2001-08-22 13:24  bagder

2001-08-21 11:16  bagder

	  HTML files are up-to-date

2001-08-21 11:16  bagder

	* docs/Makefile.am: added a 'html' target that builds HTML versions
	  from the man page sources.  It requires 'gnroff' and 'man2html'
	  for now. 'make html' will be invoked by the 'maketgz' script and
	  the HTML files are included in release archives.

2001-08-21 11:14  bagder

2001-08-21 08:56  bagder

	* configure.in: Troy Engel's fix for running configure without
	  --with-ssl

2001-08-21 08:29  bagder

	* lib/progress.c: As Andrs Garca reported we need to fflush() the
	  data->err so that the progress meter looks better on windows (and
	  if the data->err is redirected from stderr it also makes a point)

2001-08-20 15:22  bagder

	* docs/TheArtOfHttpScripting: added "4.5 FIGURE OUT WHAT A POST
	  LOOKS LIKE" added an online URL to this document corrected a bad

	* docs/curl-config.1: updated to the latest fixes to the shell
	  script

2001-08-16 15:09  bagder

	* curl-config.in: hm, --cflags should only show the flags a 3rd
	  party program would need

2001-08-16 15:05  bagder

	* curl-config.in: removed --include again and stuffed the libcurl's
	  include path in --cflags

2001-08-16 15:02  bagder

	  for libcurl

2001-08-15 23:40  bagder

	  %{http_code}, Bug #12733 over on php.net

2001-08-15 15:38  bagder

	* lib/http.c: Using CURLOPT_POST without using CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS

	  warnings

2001-08-15 09:22  bagder

	* lib/ftp.c: This can be used in another place (Curl_ftp_done :)...

	  declare at the top of the file, put the private functions at the
	  bottom of the file, however, this is clearer imho (since _ftp is
	  already there).

2001-08-15 08:55  bagder

	* lib/url.c: non-public functions should not use CURL * as
	  arguments, so I changed them to use 'struct UrlData *' instead

2001-08-15 08:54  bagder

	* lib/transfer.h: modified the Curl_perform() proto

2001-08-15 08:54  bumblebury

	  session-specific getinfo- variables

2001-08-15 08:51  bagder

	* lib/easy.c: internal functions should not use 'CURL *' as
	  arguments, I replaced them with the more appropriate 'struct
	  UrlData *' instead.

2001-08-15 08:50  bagder

	* lib/Makefile.am: added getinfo.h

2001-08-15 08:13  bagder

	* lib/Makefile.b32.resp: David James made it build 7.8.1 pre 5

2001-08-14 13:04  bagder

	  size_t and const fix, a few VMS changes

2001-08-14 11:26  bagder

	* lib/ftp.c: exchanged the second and third argument to fwrite(),
	  as that makes it look good on VMS.  Removed a '#if 0' section,
	  made Curl_getmyhost static and cut off the 'Curl_' prefix

2001-08-14 11:25  bagder

	* lib/base64.c: #include <curl/mprintf.h>

2001-08-14 11:24  bagder

	* lib/ssluse.c: removed the use of the global array for the
	  password that was necessary for OpenSSL versions prior to 0.9.4,
	  this is conditional and should still work with older versions.

2001-08-14 10:34  bagder

	* lib/sendf.h: size_t and const

2001-08-14 10:34  bagder

	  curl "standard"

2001-08-14 10:29  bagder

	  arguments instead of the previous ssize_t

	  check for size > 0 in the add_buffer function.

2001-08-14 10:27  bagder

	* lib/getpass.h: added const to the prompt char * in the proto

2001-08-14 10:24  bagder

	* lib/ftp.c: corrected the size_t weirdness. Expect size_t to be

	  the special-purpose VMS #ifdefs that were added for this.

2001-08-14 10:23  bagder

	* lib/formdata.c: added a few consts and a few typecasts to please
	  picky compiler options

2001-08-14 10:22  bagder

	  that purpose

2001-08-14 10:20  bagder

	* lib/escape.c: added typecasts when converting from unsigned int
	  to int

2001-08-14 10:19  bagder

	* lib/easy.c: Added an empty win32_cleanup for non-windows systems
	  to prevent compiler warnings, changed the Curl_open() call as the
	  second argument was never used anyway

2001-08-14 10:18  bagder

	* lib/dict.c: removed the *done() function as it served no purpose,
	  added type casts when converting from 'const char *' to 'char *'
	  to please my picky compiler options

2001-08-14 10:17  bagder

	* lib/cookie.c: commented out empty else blocks to shut up pedantic
	  compilers

2001-08-14 10:16  bagder

	* lib/arpa_telnet.h: Added 'const' to the string arrays

2001-08-14 08:06  bagder

2001-08-10 08:24  bagder

	* lib/progress.c: moved the download/upload speed calculations, to
	  be made on every invoke of the progressupdate, as on very quick
	  transfers they wouldn't always get calculated!

2001-08-10 00:43  subman

	* lib/Makefile.vc6: Fixed bugs for building debug and SSL lib in VC
	  makefile

2001-08-09 14:08  bagder

2001-08-09 13:58  bagder

	* tests/data/test26: strip off user-agent before checking protocol

2001-08-09 11:47  bagder

	* src/main.c: The redirected error stream was closed before
	  curl_easy_cleanup() was made, and when VERBOSE was enabled, that
	  used the stream. Also, the stream was closed even if we looped to
	  get more files.  Corrects Dustin Boswell's bug report #441610

2001-08-09 11:13  bagder

	* src/Makefile.vc6: removied $Id:$ again, this is treated as a
	  binary file and then that field isn't updated! :-O

2001-08-09 11:10  bagder

	  the header

	* Makefile.am: added unfortunate but necessary special-purpose
	  files for VMS and RISC OS

2001-08-08 09:35  bagder

	* src/main.c: The file name given to -E can now contain drive
	  letters on windows, if they start the file name as in 'X:\' where
	  X is any letter. The colon otherwise normally separate the file
	  name from the password.

2001-08-08 09:23  bagder

	* docs/THANKS: credit where credit is due, added a bunch of recent
	  contributors

2001-08-08 09:16  bagder

	  better and friendlier

2001-08-07 14:42  bagder

	* tests/data/: Makefile.am, test18, test19, test20, test21, test22,
	  test23, test24, test25, test26: nine new test cases

	* docs/FAQ: added  "1.7 What about CURL from curl.com?"

2001-08-07 11:21  bagder

	* src/curlmsg.msg: used under VMS

2001-08-06 14:47  bagder

	* lib/ftp.c: Nico's fixes for VMS, most of these are fixes for bad
	  uses of size_t that forgets that it is very often unsigned. These
	  should be fixed globally and then many #ifdef VMS lines can be
	  removed.

2001-08-06 14:36  bagder

	* lib/: formdata.c, formdata.h, http.c: Curl_FormFree renamed to
	  Curl_formclean, as it turns out VMS for example requires all
	  global symbols to be *case insentively* unique! curl_formfree is
	  a global function we shouldn't touch.

2001-08-06 14:27  bagder

	* lib/setup.h: adjusted for VMS

2001-08-06 14:26  bagder

	* lib/getpass.c: Nico Baggus made it work and compile under VMS!

2001-08-06 14:19  bagder

	* lib/: getenv.c, hostip.c: Nico Baggus' VMS adjustments

2001-08-06 14:17  bagder

	* lib/file.c: VMS #ifdefs added. several related to size_t problems
	  that we must address globally anyway... check these as soon as
	  the size_t fixes are in place

2001-08-06 14:16  bagder

	* lib/dllinit.c: made this whole file #ifdef WIN32

2001-08-06 14:14  bagder

	  7.8.1-pre3 commit

2001-08-06 10:22  bagder

	* lib/sendf.c:	 Jonathan Hseu noticed that you couldn't get a
	  header callback unless you
	    set CURLOPT_WRITEHEADER to non-NULL, even if you didn't care
	  about that
	    data. This is now fixed.

2001-08-06 10:18  bagder

	* lib/url.c: corrected the comment for CURLOPT_WRITEHEADER in
	  setopt(), and made it read a void * and not a FILE *, as that was
	  how it used to work and not anymore...

2001-08-05 15:00  bagder

	* CHANGES: many fixes mailed in during July

2001-08-05 14:34  bagder

	* lib/escape.c: curl_escape() no longer attempts to detect already
	  encoded stuff (in order not to re-encode it).

2001-08-05 14:30  bagder

	* lib/transfer.c: - Sergio Ballestrero provided a patch for reading
	  responses from NCSA httpd   1.5.x servers, as they return really
	  screwed up response headers when asked   for with HTTP 1.1.

2001-08-04 16:42  bagder

	  callback

2001-08-02 18:52  bagder

	  in the examples file :)

2001-07-12 03:57  bumblebury

	  lib/easy.c, src/main.c: Add win32 initialization support to
	  curl_global_init() and curl_global_cleanup().  Update
	  corresponding man pages...

	  Improve the logic in curl_global_cleanup() and curl_global_init()

2001-06-25 14:56  bagder

	* src/main.c: 'resume from'-fix. When using "-C -" and doing
	  multiple file download, the first resume was used on all files
	  instead of being reset between each file.  As found by Bjrn
	  Stenberg.

2001-06-25 11:49  bagder

	* CHANGES: - Anton Kalmykov provided a fix that makes curl work
	  with form field names   with spaces like when -F is used.

2001-06-25 11:39  bagder

	* lib/formdata.c: Anton Kalmykov's fix for dealing with form names
	  with spaces!

2001-06-21 11:39  bagder

	* CHANGES.2000: the changelog from year 2000

2001-06-20 09:48  bagder

	* CHANGES: ftp cut off transfer fix, configure --with-ssl fix

2001-06-20 09:43  bagder

	* configure.in: when --with-ssl is used with a specified path, we
	  use that path immediately to check libs and include files in, we
	  don't check the default places first!

2001-06-19 11:12  bagder

	* docs/TODO: Added items we've discussed previously, and URLs to
	  dev notes discussing the matter

2001-06-19 08:04  bagder

2001-06-18 16:37  bagder

	* lib/.cvsignore: files to ignore by default in cvs operations

2001-06-14 14:16  bagder

	* tests/runtests.pl: made stdin testing work, also made
	  'nocheck=true' work when set on the reply data section

2001-06-14 14:05  bagder

	* tests/data/: Makefile.am, test15, test16, test17: three more HTTP
	  tests added from the old test suite

2001-06-12 20:22  bagder

	* lib/ssluse.c: removed a failf() that would overwrite the previous
	  error message

2001-06-12 11:23  bagder

	  corrected, more test cases and fixed FTP ranges

2001-06-12 11:21  bagder

	* lib/url.c: Salvador Dvila's ftp range download fix

2001-06-12 11:12  bagder

	* tests/data/: Makefile.am, test101, test102, test103, test104,
	  test105, test106, test107, test33: New test cases added

2001-06-12 10:38  bagder

	* tests/ftpserver.pl: supports SIZE now

2001-06-11 14:31  bagder

	* lib/Makefile.am: corrected the -version-info

2001-06-11 14:29  bagder

	* configure.in: Added a check that 'localhost' resolves before the
	  gethostbyname_r() checks, as they depend on the resolving of that
	  name. It seems this mistake is happening from time to time and
	  people have a hard time finding out why configure can't detect
	  their gethostbyname_r()-setup.

2001-06-07 13:44  bagder

	* lib/libcurl.def: duplicate curl_unescape entry removed

2001-06-07 11:39  bagder

	* lib/: Makefile.vc6, curllib.dsp, libcurl.def: S. Moonesamy
	  updates, strtok.[ch] issues

2001-06-06 11:39  bagder

	* CVS-INFO: Added note about src/hughelp.c and the new *.cvs file
	  that can be used if you really can't generate that file.

2001-06-06 11:37  bagder

	* src/hugehelp.c.cvs: For people using CVS but with no perl, like
	  all those windows losers. They can just rename this file and cut
	  off the extension instead...

2001-06-06 11:33  bagder

	* README: corrected the CVS note about not creating a
	  subdirectory... which it does now

2001-06-05 13:48  bagder

	* CHANGES: MUTE is gone, PHP examples, new CVS structure

2001-06-05 13:27  bagder

	* lib/formdata.c: made the test-program in the bottom
	  compile/build, remember to link with strequal.o as well!

2001-06-01 23:56  bumblebury

	* curl-config.in: Add documentation for the --vernum attribute

2001-06-01 09:33  bagder

	* docs/curl_easy_setopt.3: CURLOPT_CONNECTTIMEOUT works on win32
	  these days, S. Moonesamy pointed out

2001-06-01 06:46  bumblebury

	* README: Update the cvs instructions.

2001-06-01 02:02  bumblebury

	* CVS-INFO: Test (and revert change from previous test).

2001-06-01 01:56  bumblebury

	* CVS-INFO: testing... testing... 1, 2, 3

2001-05-31 15:55  bagder

	* docs/curl_easy_setopt.3: removed CURLOPT_MUTE, it is not used
	  anymore

2001-05-31 15:52  bagder

	* include/curl/curl.h: MUTE is now considered obsolete

2001-05-31 15:50  bagder

	* lib/: sendf.c, url.c, urldata.h: CURLOPT_MUTE and data->bits.mute
	  are history, removed, gone!

2001-05-31 15:32  bagder

	* CHANGES: the global init stuff, strtok.h mess, _REENTRANT fixed

2001-05-31 13:30  bumblebury

	* lib/easy.c: Test and substance patch.

	  This is my first CVS commit :), what it does:

	  - Makes sure that parts of the cURL library don't get initialized
	  twice - Makes sure that we only free what we initialize

2001-05-31 10:41  bagder

	* docs/: curl_easy_cleanup.3, curl_easy_getinfo.3,
	  curl_easy_init.3, curl_easy_perform.3, curl_easy_setopt.3,
	  curl_escape.3, curl_formfree.3, curl_formparse.3, curl_getdate.3,
	  curl_getenv.3, curl_global_cleanup.3, curl_mprintf.3,
	  curl_slist_append.3, curl_slist_free_all.3, curl_strequal.3,
	  curl_unescape.3, curl_version.3, libcurl.5: Added CVS $Id$
	  keyword for inline version tracking

2001-05-31 10:35  bagder

	* docs/curl_global_init.3: updated to again set the flags of what
	  to init, and now also feature a set of available flags

2001-05-31 10:24  bagder

	* configure.in: fixed the dlopen check

2001-05-31 09:03  bagder

	* lib/: http.c, if2ip.c: removed _REENTRANT define

2001-05-31 09:02  bagder

	* lib/getdate.c: re-generated

2001-05-31 09:02  bagder

	* lib/strtok.h: include setup.h _before_ system includes

2001-05-31 09:01  bagder

	* lib/setup.h: if NEED_REENTRANT is set, define _REENTRANT already
	  here since it has to be defined as many include files as possible
	  (Solaris req)

2001-05-31 09:00  bagder

	* lib/getdate.y: includes setup.h, and thus I could remove the
	  _REENTRANT define

2001-05-31 08:10  bagder

	* include/curl/curl.h: the CURL_GLOBAL flags are now used to set
	  what parts to init globally

2001-05-31 08:06  bagder

	* lib/easy.c: went back to the version where the flags argument to
	  curl_global_init() specify exactly what global parts to init.
	  Thanks to Sterling Hughes really for arguing wisely.

2001-05-31 08:05  bagder

	* lib/strtok.h: removed the prototype and made it include string.h
	  instead

	     If your system, such as Solaris 2.7, lacks the strtok_r()
	  prototype in
	     string.h, then you'll face a bunch of warnings on all
	  instances
	     where strtok_r() is used.

	     There's not much we can do about it. Adding a prototype here
	  screws
	     everything up on other platforms! :-(

2001-05-31 07:55  bagder

	* lib/krb4.c: Sterling Hughes suggested we set 'static' before
	  size_t...

2001-05-30 14:51  bagder

	* lib/url.c: libcurl now has MUTE and NOPROGRESS set by default

2001-05-30 13:24  bagder

	* include/curl/curl.h, src/version.h: 7.8-pre2

2001-05-30 13:06  bagder

	* lib/: cookie.c, netrc.c, strtok.h, url.c: include strtok.h to get
	  the prototype

2001-05-30 13:06  bagder

	* lib/hostip.c: finally fixed the 'ret' compiler warning

2001-05-30 12:42  bagder

	* docs/TODO: removed python interface, there is one now! ;-)

2001-05-30 12:34  bagder

	* CHANGES: -# fix, thread fix, easy.c compile fix and more

2001-05-30 12:29  bagder

	* buildconf: made the automake line re-build from _all_ Makefile.am
	  files in the source tree

2001-05-30 10:01  bagder

	* docs/FAQ: english fix

2001-05-30 10:01  bagder

	* src/main.c: now uses CURL_GLOBAL_DEFAULT

2001-05-30 10:00  bagder

	* include/curl/curl.h, lib/easy.c, lib/ssluse.c: curl_global_init()
	  support for CURL_GLOBAL_NOT_SSL

2001-05-30 09:59  bagder

	* buildconf, reconf: Sterling Hughes's fixes

2001-05-30 06:31  crisb

	  packages/Solaris/Makefile.am: Added Solaris 'pkgadd' building
	  support to packages collection and autoconf/automake files

2001-05-29 21:28  bagder

	* acinclude.m4: not used in autoconf version 2.50

2001-05-29 21:25  bagder

	* configure.in: check for strtok_r

2001-05-29 21:20  bagder

	* lib/strtok.h: curl_ => Curl_

2001-05-29 21:20  bagder

	* lib/strtok.c: re-indented to follow "project curl"-style, renamed
	  curl_ prefix to Curl_

2001-05-29 21:17  bagder

	* lib/: cookie.c, netrc.c, url.c: strtok() replaced with strtok_r()

2001-05-29 21:17  bagder

	* buildconf: adjusted for automake 1.4+

2001-05-29 21:17  bagder

	* lib/: Makefile.am, strtok.c, strtok.h: Added strtok.[ch]

2001-05-29 21:14  bagder

	* CVS-INFO: we rqeuire autoconf 2.50 now

2001-05-29 20:30  bagder

	* src/main.c: fixed the -# to write to the same as --stderr is set
	  to

2001-05-29 16:02  bagder

	* docs/FAQ:  3.11 How do I POST with a different Content-Type?

2001-05-29 15:28  bagder

	* docs/curl_easy_setopt.3: clarified the MUTE option

2001-05-29 15:23  bagder

	* docs/INTERNALS: updated, improved language at a few places

2001-05-29 14:09  bagder

	  separate THANKS file and added that to the release archive

2001-05-29 14:09  bagder

	* docs/curl_global_cleanup.3: text: added in 7.8

2001-05-29 10:27  bagder

	* docs/curl_global_init.3: beauty fix

2001-05-29 09:20  bagder

	* lib/easy.c: global_init() takes that flag argument

2001-05-28 23:50  bagder

	* maketgz, include/curl/curl.h, src/version.h: 7.8-pre1 commit

2001-05-28 23:49  bagder

	* docs/TODO: ftps:// works

2001-05-28 17:31  bagder

	* src/main.c: adjusted the global_init() call to pass the new flag
	  argument too

2001-05-28 17:30  bagder

	* docs/curl_global_init.3, include/curl/curl.h: global_init() takes
	  a flag option now, to tell libcurl what _not_ to init.  it will
	  make it better when the application uses several libs that use
	  openssl and it also enables us to do the win32 winsock initing in
	  the future if we want to

2001-05-28 17:26  bagder

	* tests/runtests.pl: better -v use, passes -I to all perl invokes

2001-05-28 17:06  bagder

	* src/main.c: added calls to curl_global_*, they aren't really
	  needed for this application but it shows good manner to always
	  cleanup

2001-05-28 16:58  bagder

	* configure.in, curl-config.in, docs/curl-config.1: added
	  'curl-config --vernum' for hardcore hex version output

2001-05-28 16:32  bagder

	* tests/data/Makefile.am: changed the check for command1.txt to
	  test1, so that automatic testing in 'make distcheck' will work

2001-05-28 16:12  bagder

	* lib/Makefile.am: increased interface age

2001-05-28 16:12  bagder

	* lib/: easy.c, ssluse.c, ssluse.h, url.c: T. Bharath's comments
	  about SSL cleanup incorporated, and the two new curl_global_*
	  functions

2001-05-28 16:11  bagder

	* docs/: Makefile.am, curl_global_cleanup.3, curl_global_init.3,
	  libcurl.5: curl_global_cleanup and curl_global_init added to the
	  family

	* tests/data/Makefile.am: Added more test cases

2001-05-28 14:30  bagder

	* tests/data/: test10, test11, test12, test13, test14, test200,
	  test6, test7, test8, test9: test case converted to the new file
	  format

2001-05-28 13:19  bagder

	* tests/data/test5: test: HTTP over proxy

2001-05-23 17:05  bagder

	* tests/README: Removed references to the previous file format,
	  added some tests about the new format but there's still much more
	  to be said and done

2001-05-23 17:02  bagder

	* tests/: Makefile.am, ftpserver.pl, getpart.pm, httpserver.pl,
	  runtests.pl: adjusted to the new test case formats

2001-05-23 17:02  bagder

	* tests/data/Makefile.am: Removed the former files using the
	  old-style test case format, added the new ones. Many more of the
	  old ones must be "ported" to this new format to make the test
	  suite complete again.

2001-05-23 17:00  bagder

	* tests/data/: command1.txt, command10.txt, command100.txt,
	  command101.txt, command102.txt, command103.txt, command104.txt,
	  command105.txt, command106.txt, command107.txt, command108.txt,

2001-05-22 23:09  bagder

	* lib/transfer.c: store httpcode _before_ doing the FAILONERROR

2001-05-22 20:16  bagder

	* CHANGES, acconfig.h, config.guess, config.sub, configure.in,
	  ltmain.sh, docs/curl_easy_setopt.3, docs/curl_formparse.3,
	  docs/libcurl.5, include/curl/curl.h, src/config-win32.h,

2001-05-21 15:38  bagder

2001-05-21 15:33  bagder

	* configure.in: added a lame double-check for libcrypto as
	  otherwise it wouldn't get added properly! (?) Anyone has any

2001-05-21 15:30  bagder

	  download if the connection is a FTPS connection as the data
	  transfer is then done unencrypted!

2001-05-18 16:42  bagder

	* configure.in: this should not set a SSL path to LDFLAGS or
	  CPPFLAGS unless it really needs to

2001-05-18 14:55  bagder

	* docs/FAQ: added pointer to the examples/getinmemory.c source code

	  write callback to receive data in a memory chunk

2001-05-15 14:56  bagder

2001-05-14 14:09  bagder

	* tests/: ftpserver.pl, httpserver.pl, runtests.pl: pid files
	  fixes, ftp server already-running-but-no-control check

2001-05-14 13:29  bagder

2001-05-11 13:38  bagder

	* lib/transfer.h: removed unused #ifdef'ed section

2001-05-11 13:38  bagder

	* lib/: ftp.c, urldata.h: when asking for a resumed FTP transfer,
	  even though the entire file has already been transfered no longer
	  returns error but instead is OK. The reasoning behind this is of
	  course that no extra actions need to be taken and it is as if a
	  transfer had been successfully performed.

2001-05-11 09:52  bagder

	* lib/transfer.c: checkheader() added to check headers+contents
	  instead of the previous strnequal() approach that really didn't

	  blabla

2001-05-08 14:30  bagder

	* docs/: curl.1, curl_easy_setopt.3: made clear that the cookie
	  file format understood is Netscape _and_ Mozilla

2001-05-08 14:10  bagder

	* lib/ftp.c: when getting a FTP file with NOBODY, we will no longer
	  return error if SIZE doesn't work, we just don't output any size
	  info!

2001-05-07 23:25  bagder

	* tests/data/Makefile.am: Added stunnel.pem

	  parent do it as all parents would do it anyway.

2001-03-12 10:47  bagder

	* src/main.c: split up the big printf() into several ones to never

	* lib/http.c: remake Host: for each connection and it'll work with
	  proxies too

2001-03-09 17:02  bagder

	  and live happily ever after

	  (partly) with persistant connections for HTTP/1.0 replies moved
	  the 'newurl' struct field for Location: to the connectdata struct

2001-03-09 16:14  bagder

	  caused a warning with -Wall and a new gcc

2001-03-09 16:10  bagder

	  ones

	  reply320002.txt: test case 31 and 32 were added

2001-01-27 19:57  bagder

	* lib/http.c: Resume is now done with a Content-Range header
	  instead of a Range header if the request isn't GET. Presumably,
	  this is how it should be made.

2001-01-27 19:51  bagder

	* tests/httpserver.pl: minor output fix

2001-01-27 19:50  bagder

2001-01-26 16:50  bagder

	  such an address is used.

2001-01-23 11:14  bagder

	* src/urlglob.c: big reorg to make it not exit when it fails, but

	  checks that now detects the AIX-styles as well.  I added
	  --disable-thread to allow a user to disable all testing for

	  file install

2000-07-31 23:32  bagder

2000-07-31 23:31  bagder

	  the SSL calls. I did these changes when trying to run lclint on
	  the curl code.

2000-07-31 23:30  bagder

	* lib/http.c: Replacing one of the internal headers with one that
	  has no contents will now completely disable that header to get
	  sent.

	  localtime_r()

	  particular site, usable if Location: following takes "us" to
	  other servers that should not get the user and password

2000-07-25 23:15  bagder

	* lib/highlevel.c: set a bit when a Location: is followed to allow
	  code to act differently on those occations

2000-07-25 23:14  bagder

	* lib/urldata.h: curl_close is a new function pointer that can be
	  set to a protocol-specific function to get called in the

	  improvements

2000-07-25 14:13  bagder

2000-07-25 14:12  bagder

2000-02-16 01:05  bagder

	* src/main.c: Starting working on the '-w/--write-out' output
	  format specifier, although I didn't get that far! ;-) I also made
	  curl *not* prevent the progress meter even if the output is a tty
	  when your uploading (it is still done when downloading though). A
	  HTTP POST is in that sense seen as an upload. It seemed so
	  confusing that ftp upload doesn't display a progress meter by
	  default.

2000-02-16 01:02  bagder

	* lib/urldata.h: added #include <timeval.h> on Jrn's advice added

	  final meter update so that the final values actually are
	  displayed last.

2000-02-15 00:19  bagder

	  of progress-functions

	* lib/getdate.y: Ellis Pritchard <ellis@citria.com> made it work
	  for MacOS X

2000-02-11 00:15  bagder

	* lib/http.c: This should no longer send empty cookies to the
	  server

2000-02-11 00:14  bagder

	* lib/cookie.c: * Made '-' as file name to read cookies from equal
	  stdin.  * I hope I finally removed 'empty cookies' crash

2000-02-11 00:03  bagder

	* src/main.c: - Paul Marquis <pmarquis@iname.com> fixed the config
	  file parsing of curl to   deal with any-length lines, removing

	* lib/: dict.c, ftp.c, http.c: Adjusted to use the new Transfer()
	  instead of the old Download()

2000-02-02 00:51  bagder

	* lib/: download.c, download.h: Download() was merged with Upload()
	  and now they both form the new Transfer() function that deals
	  with both directions at the same time.

2000-02-02 00:50  bagder

	* lib/: upload.c, upload.h: Upload() and Download() are now
	  Transfer()!

	  one and that should be the only time it is required.

	* lib/progress.c: assume 79 columns instead of 80 in case we don't
	  know, to better work on win32 systems

2000-01-19 22:57  bagder

	* lib/url.c:  - Oskar Liljeblad <osk@hem.passagen.se> pointed out
	  and corrected a problem
	     in the Location: following system that made curl following a
	  location: to a
	     different protocol to fail.

2000-01-17 18:31  bagder

	* FEATURES: Added the post transfer quote feature

2000-01-17 18:30  bagder

	* FILES: Added the config-win32.h in the tree root, which is a
	  config.h file that should include all the config lines that is
