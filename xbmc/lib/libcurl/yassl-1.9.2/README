*** Note, Please read ***

yaSSL takes a different approach to certificate verification than OpenSSL does.
The default policy for the client is to verify the server, this means that if
you don't load CAs to verify the server you'll get a connect error, unable to 
verify.  It you want to mimic OpenSSL behavior of not verifying the server and
reducing security you can do this by calling:

SSL_CTX_set_verify(ctx, SSL_VERIFY_NONE, 0);

before calling SSL_new();

    and SHA-384.

See normal  build instructions below under 1.0.6.
See libcurl build instructions below under 1.3.0 and note in 1.5.8.

*****************yaSSL Release notes, version 1.5.8 (1/10/07)

    This release of yaSSL contains bug fixes, portability enhancements, and
    support for GCC 4.1.1 and vs2005 sp1.



    Since yaSSL now supports zlib, as does libcur, the libcurl build test can
    fail if yaSSL is built with zlib support since the zlib library isn't 
    passed.  You can do two things to fix this: 

        1) build yaSSL w/o zlib --without-zlib
        2) or add flags to curl configure LDFLAGS="-lm -lz"



*****************yaSSL Release notes, version 1.5.0 (11/09/06)

    This release of yaSSL contains bug fixes, portability enhancements,
    and full TLS 1.1 support.  Use the functions:

        SSL_METHOD *TLSv1_1_server_method(void);
        SSL_METHOD *TLSv1_1_client_method(void);
    
    or the SSLv23 versions (even though yaSSL doesn't support SSL 2.0 the v23
    means to pick the highest of SSL 3.0, TLS 1.0, or TLS 1.1).


See normal  build instructions below under 1.0.6.
See libcurl build instructions below under 1.3.0.



****************yaSSL Release notes, version 1.4.5 (10/15/06)


    This release of yaSSL contains bug fixes, portability enhancements,
    zlib compression support, removal of assembly instructions at runtime if
    not supported, and initial TLS 1.1 support.


    Compression Notes:  yaSSL uses zlib for compression and the compression
    should only be used if yaSSL is at both ends because the implementation
    details aren't yet standard.  If you'd like to turn compression on use
    the SSL_set_compression() function on the client before calling
    SSL_connect().  If both the client and server were built with zlib support
    then the connection will use compression.  If the client isn't built with
    support then SSL_set_compression() will return an error (-1).

    To build yaSSL with zlib support on Unix simply have zlib support on your
    system and configure will find it if it's in the standard locations.  If
    it's somewhere else use the option ./configure --with-zlib=DIR.  If you'd
    like to disable compression support in yaSSL use ./configure --without-zlib.

    To build yaSSL with zlib support on Windows:

        1) download zlib from http://www.zlib.net/
        2) follow the instructions in zlib from projects/visualc6/README.txt
           for how to add the zlib project into the yaSSL workspace noting that
           you'll need to add configuration support for "Win32 Debug" and
           "Win32 Release" in note 3 under "To use:". 
        3) define HAVE_LIBZ when building yaSSL

See normal build instructions below under 1.0.6.


--To build for libcurl on Linux, Solaris, *BSD, Mac OS X, or Cygwin:

  To build for libcurl the library needs to be built without C++ globals since
  the linker will be called in a C context, also libcurl configure will expect
  OpenSSL library names so some symbolic links are created.

    ./configure --enable-pure-c
    make
    make openssl-links

    (then go to your libcurl home and tell libcurl about yaSSL build dir)
    ./configure --with-ssl=/yaSSL-BuildDir LDFLAGS=-lm
    make


--To build for libcurl on Win32:

    Simply add the yaSSL project as a dependency to libcurl, add 
    yaSSL-Home\include and yaSSL-Home\include\openssl to the include list, and
    define USE_SSLEAY and USE_OPENSSL

    please email todd@yassl.com if you have any questions.

*** Update Build ***

If you have already done a complete build of yaSSL as described in the release
0.0.1 - 0.1.0 notes and downloaded the update to 0.2.0, place the update file
yassl-update-0.2.0.tar.gz in the yaSSL home directory and issue the command:

gzip -cd yassl-update-0.2.0.tar.gz | tar xvf -

to update the previous release.

Then issue the make command on linux or rebuild the yaSSL project on Windows. 

*******************yaSSL Release notes, version 0.1.0

**********************

yassl Release notes, version 0.0.1

The first release of yassl supports normal RSA mode SSLv3 connections with
support for SHA-1 and MD5 digests.  Ciphers include DES, 3DES, and RC4.

yassl uses the CryptoPP library for cryptography, the source is available at
www.cryptopp.com .

yassl uses CML (the Certificate Management Library) for x509 support.  More
features will be in future versions.  The CML source is available for download
from www.digitalnet.com/knowledge/cml_home.htm .

The next release of yassl will support the 3 lesser-used SSL connection modes;
HandShake resumption, Ephemeral RSA (or DH), and Client Authentication as well
as full support for TLS.  Backwards support for SSLv2 is not planned at this
time.


**********************

Building yassl on linux:

use the ./buildall script to build everything.

buildall will configure and build CML, CryptoPP, and yassl.  Testing was 
preformed with gcc version 3.3.2 on kernel 2.4.22.


**********************

Building yassl on Windows:

Testing was preformed on Windows 2000 with Visual C++ 6 sp5.

1) decompress esnacc_r16.tgz in place, see buildall for syntax if unsure

2) decompress smp_r23.tgz in place

3) unzip cryptopp51/crypto51.zip in place

4) Build SNACC (part of CML) using snacc_builds.dsw in the SNACC directory

5) Build SMP (part of CMP) using smp.dsw in the smp directory

6) Build yassl using yassl.dsw


**********************

examples, server and client:

Please see the server and client examples in both versions to see how to link
to yassl and the support libraries.  On linux do 'make server' and 'make
client' to build them. On Windows you will find the example projects in the
main workspace, yassl.dsw.

The example server and client are compatible with openssl.


**********************

Building yassl into mysql on linux:

Testing was done using mysql version 4.0.17.

alter openssl_libs in the configure file, line 21056. Change '-lssl -lcrypto'
to '-lyassl -lcryptopp -lcmapi -lcmlasn -lctil -lc++asn1'.

see build/config_command for the configure command used to configure mysql
please change /home/touska/ to the relevant directory of course.

add yassl/lib to the LD_LIBRARY_PATH because libmysql/conf_to_src does not
use the ssl lib directory though it does use the ssl libraries.

make

make install
