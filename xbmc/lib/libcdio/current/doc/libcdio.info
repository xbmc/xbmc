1 History
*********

As a result of the repressive Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) I
became aware of Video CD's (VCD's). Video CD's are not subject to the
DMCA and therefore enjoy the protection afforded by copyright but no
more. But in order for VCD's to be competitive with DVD's, good tools
(including GPL tools) are needed for authoring and playing them. And so
through VCD's I became aware of the excellent Video CD tools by Herbert
Valerio Riedel which form the `vcdimager' package.

Although vcdimager is great for authoring, examining and extracting
parts of a Video CD, it is not a VCD player. And when I looked at the
state of Video CD handling in existing VCD players: `xine', `MPlayer',
and `vlc', I was a bit disappointed. None handled playback control,
menu selections, or playing still frames and segments from track 1.

Version 0.7.12 of vcdimager was very impressive, however it lacked
exportable libraries that could be used in other projects. So with the
blessing and encouragement of Herbert Valerio Riedel, I took to extract
and create libraries from this code base. The result was two libraries:
one to extract information from a VCD which I called libvcdinfo, and
another to do the reading and control of a VCD. Well, actually, at this
point I should say that a Video CD is really just Video put on a
existing well-established Compact Disc or CD format. So the library for
this is called `libcdio' rather than `libvcdio'.

While on the topic of the name `libcdio', I should also explain that
the library really doesn't handle writing or output (the final "o" in
the name). However it was felt that if I put libcdi that might be
confused with a particular CD format called CD-I.

Later on, the ISO-9660 filesystem handling component from `vcdimager'
was extracted, expanded and made a separate library. Next the ability
to add MMC commands was added, and then CD paranoia support. And from
there, the rest is history.

2 The problem and previous work
*******************************

If around the year 2002 you were to look at the code for a number of
open-source CD or media players that work on several platforms such as
vlc, MPlayer, xine, or xmms to name but a few, you'd find the code to
read a CD sprinkled with conditional compilation for this or that
platform. That is there was _no_ OS-independent programmer library for
CD reading and control even though the technology was over 10 years
old; yet there are media players which strive for OS independence.

One early CD player, `xmcd' by Ti Kan, was I think a bit better than
most in that it tried to _encapsulate_ the kinds of CD control
mechanisms (SCSI, Linux ioctl, Toshiba, etc.) in a "CD Audio Device
Interface Library" called libdi.  However this library is for Audio
CD's only and I don't believe this library has been used outside of
xmcd.

Another project, Simple DirectMedia Layer also encapsulates CD reading.

     SDL is a library that allows you portable low-level access to a
     video framebuffer, audio output, mouse, and keyboard. With SDL, it
     is easy to write portable games which run on ...

Many of the media players mentioned above do in fact can make use of
the SDL library but for _video_ output only. Because the encapsulation
is over _many_ kinds of I/O (video, joysticks, mice, as well as CD's),
I believe that the level of control provided for CD a little bit
limited. (However to be fair, it may have only been intended for games
and may be suitable for that).  Applications that just want the CD
reading and control portion I think will find quite a bit overhead.

Another related project is Jo"rg Schilling's SCSI library. You can use
that to make a non-SCSI CD-ROM act like one that understands SCSI MMC
commands which is a neat thing to do. However it is a little weird to
have to install drivers just so you can run a particular user-level
program. Installing drivers often requires special privileges and
permissions and it is pervasive on a system. It is a little sad that
along the way to creating such a SCSI library a library similar to
`libcdio' wasn't created which could be used. Were that the case, this
library certainly never would have been written.

At the OS level there is the "A Linux CD-ROM Standard" by David van
Leeuwen from around 1999. This defines a set of definitions and ioctl's
that mask hardware differences of various Compact Disc hardware. It is
a great idea, however this "standard" lacked adoption on OS's other
than GNU/Linux. Or maybe it's the case that the standard on other OS's
lacked adoption on GNU/Linux. For example on FreeBSD there is a "Common
Access Method" (CAM) used for all SCSI access which seems not to be
adopted in GNU/Linux.(1)

Finally at the hardware level where a similar chaos exists, there has
been an attempt to do something similar with the MMC (multimedia
commands). This attempts to provide a uniform command set for CD
devices PostScript does for printer commands.(2) In contrast to
PostScript where there one in theory can write a PostScript program in
a uniform ASCII representation and send that to a printer, for MMC
although there are common internal structures defined, there is no
common syntax for representing the structures or an OS-independent
library or API for issuing MMC-commands which a programmer would need
to use. Instead each Operating System has its own interface.  For
example Adaptec's ASPI or Microsoft's DeviceIoControl on Microsoft
Windows, or IOKit for Apple's OS/X, or FreeBSD's CAM. I've been
positively awed at how many different variations and differing levels
of complexity there are for doing basically the same thing. How easy it
is to issue an MMC command from a program varies from easy to very
difficult. And mastering the boilerplate code to issue an MMC command
on one OS really doesn't help much in figuring out how to do it on
another OS. So in `libcdio' we provide a common (and hopefully simple)
API to issue MMC commands.

---------- Footnotes ----------

(1) And I'm thankful for that since, at least for MMC commands, it is
inordinately complicated and in some places arcane.

(2) I wrote "attempts" because over time the command set has changed
and now there are several different commands to do a particular
function like read a CD table of contents and some hardware understands
some of the version of the commands set but might not others

3 What is in this package (and what's not)
******************************************

The library, `libcdio', encapsulates CD-ROM reading and control.
Applications wishing to be oblivious of the OS- and device-dependent
properties of a CD-ROM can use this library.

Also included is a library, `libiso9660', for working with ISO-9660
filesystems, `libcdio_paranoia', and `libcdio_cdda' libraries for
applications which want to use cdparanoia's error-correction and jitter
detection.

Some support for disk-image types like cdrdao's TOC, CDRWIN's BIN/CUE
and Ahead Nero's NRG format is available, so applications that use this
library also have the ability to read disc images as though they were
CDs.

`libcdio' also provides a way to issue SCSI "MultiMedia Commands"
(MMC).  MMC is supported by many hardware CD-ROM manufacturers; and in
some cases where a CD-ROM doesn't understand MMC directly, some
Operating Systems (such as GNU/Linux, Solaris, or FreeBSD or Microsoft
Windows ASPI to name a few) provide the MMC emulation.(1)

The first use of the library in this package are the Video CD authoring
and ripping tools, VCDImager (`http://vcdimager.org'). See
`http://www.gnu.org/software/libcdio/projects.html' for a list of
projects using `libcdio'.

A version of the CD-DA extraction tool cdparanoia
(`http://www.xiph.org/paranoia' and its library which corrects for
CD-ROM jitter are part of the distribution.

Also included in the libcdio package is a utility program `cd-info'
which displays CD information: number of tracks, CD-format and if
possible basic information about the format.  If libcddb
(`http://libcddb.sourceforge.net') is available, the `cd-info' program
will display CDDB matches on CD-DA discs. And if a new enough version
of libvcdinfo is available (from the vcdimager project), then `cd-info'
shows basic VCD information.

Other utility programs in the libcdio package are:

``cdda-player''
     shows off `libcdio' audio and CD-ROM control commands. It can play
     a track, eject or load media and show the the status of a CD-DA
     that is might be currently played via the audio control commands.
     It can be run in batch mode or has a simple curses-based interface.

     If libcddb is available or a CD has CD-Text and your CD-ROM drive
     supports CD-Text, track/album information about the CD can be
     shown.

``cd-drive''
     shows what drivers are available and some basic properties of
     cd-drives attached to the system. (But media may have to be
     inserted in order to get this info.)  lists out drive capabilities

`cd-read'
     performs low-level block reading of a CD or CD image,

``iso-info''
     displays ISO-9660 information from an ISO-9660 image. Below is some
     sample output

``iso-read''
     extracts files from an ISO-9660 image.


At present, there is no support for writing CD's. Nor is there any
support for reading or writing DVDs. For some of these, there are other
libraries (e.g. libdi, libscg, or libdvdread) may be helpful.

I'm not theoretically opposed to putting support like this into
libcdio. However at present there are already many gaps in this
package, so narrowing its scope in order to focus on these things I
think is a good idea.

language is common for printers such as using ghostscript to private
postscript emulation for a non-postscript printer.

We give just enough background here to cover Compact Discs and Compact
Disc formats that are handled by this library.

The Sony and Philips Corporations invented and Compact Disc (CD) in the
early 1980s. The specifications for the layout is often referred to by
the color of the cover on the specification.

4.1 Red Book (CD-DA)
====================

* Menu:

* CD Text::         CD Text and CD+G
* CDDB::            Internet CD Database (CDDB)

The first type of CD that was produced was the Compact Disc Digital
Audio (CD-DA) or just plain "audio CD". The specification, ICE 60908
(formerly IEC 908) is commonly called the "Red Book",
``http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Book_(audio_CD_standard)''. Music
CD's are recorded in this format which basically allows for around 74
minutes of audio per disc and for that information to be split up into
tracks. Tracks are broken up into "sectors" and each sector contains up
to 2,352 bytes. To play one 44.1 kHz CD-DA sampled audio second, 75
sectors are used.

The minute/second/frame numbering of sectors or MSF format is based on
the fact that 75 sectors are used in a second of playing of sound. (And
for almost every other CD format and application the MSF format doesn't
make that much sense).

In `libcdio' when you you want to read an audio sector, you call
`cdio_read_audio_sector()' or `cdio_read_audio_sectors()'.

In addition the the audio data "channel" a provision for other
information or _subchannel_ information) can be stored in a sector.
Other subchannels include a Media Catalog Number (also abbreviated as
MCN and sometimes a UPC), or album meta data (also called CD-Text).
Karioke graphics can also be stored in a format called _CD+G_.


File: libcdio.info,  Node: CD Text,  Next: CDDB,  Up: Red Book

4.1.1 CD Text, CD+G
-------------------

CD Text is an extension to the CD-DA standard that adds the ability to
album and track meta data (titles, artist/performer names, song titles)
and and graphical (e.g. Karioke) information.  For an alternative way
to get album and track meta-data see *Note CDDB::.

Information is stored in such a way that it doesn't interfere with the
normal operation of any CD players or CDROM drives. There are two
different parts of the CD where the data can be stored.

The first place the information can be recorded is in the R-W sub codes
in the lead in area of the CD giving a data capacity of about 5,000
ASCII characters (or 2,500 Kanji or Unicode characters).  This
information is stored as a single block of data and is the format used
in virtually all of the CD Text CDs shipping today. The method for
reading this data from a CDROM drive is covered under the Sony proposal
to the MMC specification. The format of the data is partially covered
in the MMC specification.

The second place the information can be recorded is in the R-W sub
codes in the program area of the CD giving a data capacity of roughly
31MB. This information is stored in a format that follows the
Interactive Text Transmission System (ITTS) which is the same data
transmission standard used by such things as Digital Audio Broadcasting
(DAB), and virtually the same as the data standard for the MiniDisc.
Traditionally the R-W sub codes have been used for text and graphics in
applications such as CD+G (CD w/graphics) or in the case of most audio
CDs, not at all. The methods for reading this data from a CD-ROM drive
is covered by the programming specs from the individual drive
manufacturers. In the case of ATAPI drives, the SFF8020 spec covers the
reading of the RW subcodes.

Not all drives support reading the RW subcodes from the program area.
However for those that do, `libcdio' provides a way to get at this
information via `cdtext_get()' and its friends.


File: libcdio.info,  Node: CDDB,  Prev: CD Text,  Up: Red Book

4.1.2 Internet CD Database (CDDB)
---------------------------------

CDDB is an database on the Internet of of CD album/track, artist, and
genre information similar to CD Text information. Using track
information (number of tracks and length of the tracks), devices that
have access to the Internet can query for meta information and
contribute information for CD's where there is no existing information.
When storage is available (such as you'd expect for any program using
`libcdio', the information is often saved for later use when the
Internet is not available; people tend request the same information
since they via programs play the same music.

Obtaining CD meta information when none is encoded in an audio CD is
useful in media players or making one's own compilations from audio CDs.

There are currently two popular CDDB services on the Internet. The
original database has been renamed Gracenote and is a profit making
entity. FreeDB (`http://freedb.org' is an open source CD information
resource that is free for developers and the public to use.

As there already is an excellent library for handling CDDB libcddb
(`http://libcddb.sourceforge.net' we suggest using that. Our utility
program `cd-info' will make use it if it is available and it's what we
use in our applications that need it.

4.2 Yellow Book (CD-ROM Digital Data)
=====================================

The CD-ROM specification or the "Yellow Book" followed a few years
later (Standards ISO/IEC 10149), and describes the extension of CD's to
store computer data, i.e. CD-ROM (Compact Disk Read Only Memory).

The specification in the Yellow Book defines two modes: Mode 1 and Mode
2.

* Menu:

* ISO 9660::
* Mode 1::           Mode 1 Format
* Mode 2::           Mode 2 Format


File: libcdio.info,  Node: ISO 9660,  Next: Mode 1,  Up: Yellow Book

4.2.1 ISO 9660
--------------

* Menu:

* ISO 9660 Level 1::
* ISO 9660 Level 2::
* ISO 9660 Level 3::
* Joliet Extensions::
* Rock Ridge Extensions::

The Yellow Book doesn't specify how data is to be stored on a CD-ROM.
It was feared that different companies would implement proprietary data
storage formats using this specification, resulting in incompatible
data CDs. To prevent this, representatives of major manufacturers met
at the High Sierra Hotel and Casino in Lake Tahoe, NV, in 1985, to
define a standard for storing data on CDs. This format was nicknamed
High Sierra Format. In a slightly modified form it was later adopted as
ISO the ISO 9660 standard. This standard is further broken down into 3
"levels", the higher the level, the more permissive.


File: libcdio.info,  Node: ISO 9660 Level 1,  Next: ISO 9660 Level 2,  Up: ISO 9660

4.2.1.1 ISO 9660 Level 1
........................

Level 1 ISO 9660 defines names in the 8+3 convention so familiar to
MS-DOS: eight characters for the filename, a period, and then three
characters for the file type, all in upper case. The allowed characters
are A-Z, 0-9, ".", and "_".Level 1 ISO 9660 requires that files occupy
a contiguous range of sectors. This allows a file to be specified with
a start block and a count. The maximum directory depth is 8. For a
table of the characters, see *Note ISO-9660 Character Sets::.


File: libcdio.info,  Node: ISO 9660 Level 2,  Next: ISO 9660 Level 3,  Prev: ISO 9660 Level 1,  Up: ISO 9660

4.2.1.2 ISO 9660 Level 2
........................

Level 2 ISO 9660 allows far more flexibility in filenames, but isn't
usable on some systems, notably MS-DOS.


File: libcdio.info,  Node: ISO 9660 Level 3,  Next: Joliet Extensions,  Prev: ISO 9660 Level 2,  Up: ISO 9660

4.2.1.3 ISO 9660 Level 3
........................

Level 3 ISO-9660 allows non-contiguous files, useful if the file was
written in multiple packets with packet-writing software.

There have been a number of extensions to the ISO 9660 CD-ROM file
format. One extension is Microsoft's Joliet specification, designed to
resolve a number of deficiencies in the original ISO 9660 Level 1 file
system, and in particular to support the long file names used in
Windows 95 and subsequent versions of Windows.

Another extension is the Rock Ridge Interchange Protocol (RRIP), which
enables the recording of sufficient information to support POSIX File
System semantics.


File: libcdio.info,  Node: Joliet Extensions,  Next: Rock Ridge Extensions,  Prev: ISO 9660 Level 3,  Up: ISO 9660

4.2.1.4 Joliet Extensions
.........................

Joliet extensions were an upward-compatible extension to the ISO 9660
specification that removes the limitation initially put in to deal with
the limited filename conventions found in Microsoft DOS OS. In
particular, the Joliet specification allows for long filenames and
allows for UCS-BE (Big-endian Unicode) encoding of filenames which
include mixed case letter, accented characters spaces and various
symbols.

The way all of this is encoded is by adding a second directory and
filesystem structure in addition to or in parallels to original ISO
9600 filesystem. The root node of the ISO 9660 filesystem is found via
the _Primary Volume Descriptor_ or _PVD_. The root of the Joliet-encode
filesystem is found in a Supplementary Volume Descriptor or _SVD_
defined in the ISO 9660 specification. The SVD structure is almost
identical to a PVD with a couple of unused fields getting used and with
the filename encoding changed to UCS-BE.


File: libcdio.info,  Node: Rock Ridge Extensions,  Prev: Joliet Extensions,  Up: ISO 9660

4.2.1.5 Rock Ridge Extensions
.............................

Using the Joliet Extension one overcome the limitedness of the original
ISO-9660 naming scheme. But another and probably better method is to
use the Rock Ridge Extension. Not only can one store a filename as one
does in a POSIX OS, but the other file attributes, such as the various
timestamps (creation, modification, access), file attributes (user,
group, file mode permissions, device type, symbolic links) can be
stored. This is much as one would do in XA attributes; however the two
are not completely interchangeable in the information they store: XA
does _not_ address filename limitations, and the Rock Ridge extensions
don't indicate if a sector is in Mode 1 or Mode 2 format.

The Rock Ridge extension makes use of a hook that was defined as part
of the ISO 9660 standard.


File: libcdio.info,  Node: Mode 1,  Next: Mode 2,  Prev: ISO 9660,  Up: Yellow Book

4.2.2 Mode 1 (2048 data bytes per sector)
-----------------------------------------

Mode 1 is the data storage mode used by to store computer data. There
are 3 layers of error correction. A Compact Disc using only this format
can hold at most 650 MB. The data is laid out in basically the same way
as in and audio CD format, except that the 2,352 bytes of data in each
block are broken down further. 2,048 of these bytes are for "real"
data. The other 304 bytes are used for an additional level of error
detecting and correcting code. This is necessary because data CDs
cannot tolerate the loss of a handful of bits now and then, the way
audio CDs can.

In `libcdio' when you you want to read a mode1 sector you call the
`cdio_read_mode1_sector()' or `cdio_read_mode1_sectors()'.


File: libcdio.info,  Node: Mode 2,  Prev: Mode 1,  Up: Yellow Book

4.2.3 Mode 2 (2336 data bytes per sector)
-----------------------------------------

Mode 2 data CDs are the same as mode 1 CDs except that the error
detecting and correcting codes are omitted. So still there are 2 layers
of error correction. A Compact Disc using only this mode can thus hold
at most 742 MB. Similar to audio CDs, the mode 2 format provides a more
flexible vehicle for storing types of data that do not require high
data integrity: for example, graphics and video can use this format.
But in contrast to the Red Book standard, different modes can be mixed
together; this is the basis for the extensions to the original data CD
standards known as CD-ROM Extended Architecture, or CD-ROM XA.  CD-ROM
XA formats currently in use are CD-I Bridge formats, Photo CD and Video
CD plus Sony's Playstation.

In `libcdio' when you you want to read a mode1 sector you call the
`cdio_read_mode2_sector()' or `cdio_read_mode2_sectors()'.

4.3 Green Book (CD-i)
=====================

This was a CD-ROM format developed by Philips for CD-i (an obsolete
embedded CD-ROM application allowing limited user user interaction with
films, games and educational applications). The format is ISO 9660
compliant and introduced mode 2 form 2 addressing. It also contains XA
(Extended Architecture) attributes.

Although some Green Book discs contain CD-i applications which can only
be played on a CD-i player, others have films or music videos. Video
CDs in Green-Book format are labeled "Digital Video on CD." The Green
Book for video is largely superseded by White book CD-ROM which draws
on this specification.


File: libcdio.info,  Node: White Book,  Prev: Green Book,  Up: CD Formats

4.4 White Book (DV, Video CD)
=============================

The White Book was released by Sony, Philips, Matsushita, and JVC in
1993, defines the Video CD specification. The White Book is also known
as Digital Video (DV).

A Video CD contains one data track recorded in CD-ROM XA Mode 2 Form 2.
It is always the first track on the disc (Track 1). The ISO-9660 file
structure and a CD-i application program are recorded in this track, as
well as the Video CD Information Area which gives general information
about the Video Compact Disc. After the data track, video is written in
one or more subsequent tracks within the same session. These tracks are
also recorded in Mode 2 Form 2.

In `libcdio' when you you want to read a mode2 format 2 audio sector

5 CD Image Formats
******************

* Menu:

* CDRDAO TOC Format::
* CDRWIN BIN/CUE Format::
* NRG Format::

In both the `cdrdao' and bin/cue formats there is one meta-file with
extensions `.toc' or `.cue' respectively and one or more files (often
with the extension `.bin') which contains the content of tracks. The
format of the track data is often interchangeable between the two
formats.  For example, in `libcdio''s regression tests we make use of
this to reduce the size of the test data and just provide alternate
meta-data files (`.toc' or `.cue').

In contrast to the first two formats, the NRG format consists of a
single file. This has the advantage of being a self-contained unit: in
the other two formats it is possible for the meta file to refer to a
file that can't be found. A disadvantage of the NRG format is that the
meta data can't be easily viewed or modified say in a text file as it
can be with the first two formats. In conjunction with this
disadvantage is another disadvantage that the format is not documented,
so how `libcdio' interprets an NRG image is based on inference. It is
recommended that one of the other forms be used instead of NRG where
possible.

5.1 CDRDAO TOC Format
=====================

This is `cdrdao''s CD-image description format. Since this program is
GPL and everything about it is in the open, it is the preferred format
to use. (Alas, at present it isn't as well supported in `libcdio' as
the BIN/CUE format.)

The _toc_-file describes what data is written to the media in the
CD-ROM; it allows control over track/index positions, pre-gaps and
sub-channel information.  It is a text file, so a text editor can be
used to create, view or modify it.

The `cdrdao(1) manual page', contains more information about this
format.

5.1.1 CDRDAO Grammar
--------------------

Below are the lexical tokens and grammar for a cdrdao TOC. It was taken
from the cdrdao's pacct grammar; the token and nonterminal names are
the same.

5.2 CDRWIN BIN/CUE Format
=========================

The format referred to as _CDRWIN BIN/CUE Format_ in this manual is a
popular CD image format used in the PC world. Not unlike `cdrdao''s TOC
file, the _cue_ file describes the track layout, i.e. how the sectors
are to be placed on the CD media. The _cue_ file usually contains a
reference to a file traditionally having the `.bin' extension in its
filename, the _bin_ file. This _bin_ file contains the sector data
payload which is to be written to the CD medium according to the
description in the _cue_ file.

The following is an attempt to describe the subset of the `.cue' file
syntax used in `libcdio' and vcdimager in an EBNF-like notation:

5.2.1 BIN/CUE Grammar
---------------------

<cue-document> ::= +( <file-line> +<track-expr> )

                  | "\"" <pathname-str> "\""

<file-type> ::= "BINARY"

<track-expr> ::= <track-line> [ <flag-line> ]
                 [ <pregap-line> ] *<index-line> [ <postgap-line> ]

<flag-type> ::= "DCP"

<track-line> ::= "TRACK" <number> <track-type> <EOL>

<pregap-line> ::= "PREGAP" <msf> <EOL>

<index-line> ::= "INDEX" <number> <msf> <EOL>

<postgap-line> ::= "POSTGAP" <msf> <EOL>

<track-type> ::= "AUDIO" | "MODE1/2048" | "MODE1/2352"
               | "MODE2/2336" | "MODE2/2352"

<comment-line> ::= "REM" *<char> <EOL>

5.3 NRG Format
==============

The format referred to as _NRG Format_ in this manual is another
popular CD image format. It is available only on Nero software on a
Microsoft Windows Operating System. It is proprietary and not generally
published, so the information we have comes from guessing based on
sample CD images. So support for this is incomplete and using this
format is not recommended.

Unlike `cdrdao''s TOC file the BIN/CUE format everything is contained
in one file. that one can edit Meta information such as the number of
tracks and track format is contained at the end of the file. This
information is not intended to be edited through a text editor.

File: libcdio.info,  Node: Tracks,  Next: Sectors,  Up: CD Units

6.1 tracks -- disc subdivisions
===============================

In this section we describe CD properties and terms that we make use of
in `libcdio'.

A CD is formated into a number of _tracks_, and a CD can hold at most
99 such tracks. This is defined by `CDIO_CD_MAX_TRACKS' in
`cdio/sector.h'. Between the tracks CD specifications require a "2
second" in gap (called a _lead-in gap_. This is unused space with no
"data" similar to the space between tracks on an old phonograph. The
word "second" here really refers to a measure of space and not really
necessarily an amount of time. However in the special case that the CD
encodes an audio CD or CD-DA, the amount of time to play a gap of this
size will take 2 seconds.

The beginning (or inner edge) of the CD is supposed to have a "2
second" lead-in gap and there is supposed to be another "2 second"
_lead-out_ gap at the end (or outer edge) of the CD.

People have discovered that they can put useful data in the various
gaps and their equipment can read this, violating the standards but
allowing a CD to store more data.

In order to determine the number of tracks on a CD and where they
start, commands are used to get this table-of-contents or _TOC_
information. Asking about the start of the _lead-out track_ gives the
amount of data stored on the Compact Disk. To make it easy to specify
this leadout track, special constant 0xAA (decimal 170) is used to
indicate it. This is safe since this is higher than the largest legal
track position. In `libcdio', `CDIO_CDROM_LEADOUT_TRACK' is defined to
be this special value.


File: libcdio.info,  Node: Sectors,  Prev: Tracks,  Up: CD Units

6.2 block addressing (MSF, LSN, LBA)
====================================

A track is broken up into a number of 2352-byte _blocks_ which we
sometimes call _sectors_ or _frames_. Whereas tracks have to have a gap
between them, a block or sector does not. (In `libcdio' the block size
constant is defined using `CDIO_CD_FRAMESIZE_RAW').

A Compact Disc has a limit on the number of blocks or sectors.  This
values is defined by constant `CDIO_CD_MAX_LSN' in `cdio/sector.h'.

One can addressing a block in one of three formats. The oldest format
is by it's minute/second/frame number, also referred to as _MSF_ and
written in time-like format MM:SS:FF (e.g. 30:01:40). It is best suited
in audio (Red Book) applications. In `libcdio', the type `msf_t' can be
used to declare variables to hold such values. Minute, second and frame
values are one byte _and stored BCD notation_.(1) There are `libcdio'
conversion routines `cdio_from_bcd8()' and `cdio_to_bcd8()' to convert
the minute, second, and frame values into or out of integers. If you
want to print a field in a BCD-encoded MSF, one can use the format
specifier `%x' _(not `%d')_ and things will come out right.

In the MSF notation, there are 75 "frames" in a "second," and the
familiar (if awkward) 60 seconds in a minute. _Frame_ here is what we
called a _block_ above. The CD specification defines "frame" to be
_another_ unit which makes up a block. Very confusing. A frame is also
sometimes called a sector, analogous to hard-disk terminalogy.

Even more confusing is using this time-like notation for an address or
for a length. Too often people confuse the MSF notation this with an
amount of time. A "second" (or `CDIO_CD_FRAMES_PER_SEC' blocks) in this
notation is only a second of playing time for something encoded as
CD-DA. It does _not_ necessarily represent the amount time that it will
take to play a of Video CD--usually you need more blocks than this. Nor
does it represent the amount of data used to play a second of an
MP3--usually you need fewer blocks than this. It is also not the amount
of time your CD-ROM will take to read a "second" of data off a Compact
Disc: for example a 12x CD player will read 12x `CDIO_CD_FRAMES_PER_SEC'
`CDIO_CD_FRAMSIZE_RAW'-byte blocks in a one second of time.

When programming, unless one is working with a CD-DA (and even here,
only in a time-like fashion), is generally more cumbersome to use an
MSF rather than a LBA or LSN described below, since subtraction of two
MSF's has the awkwardness akin to subtraction using Roman Numerals.

Probably the simplest way to address a block is to use its _LSN_ or
"logical sector number." This just numbers the blocks usually from 0
on. _fix me: LSNs can be negative up to the pregap size?_ The Lead-in
and Lead-out gaps described above have LSNs just like any other space
on a CD. The last unit of address is a _LBA_. It is the same as a LSN
but the 150 blocks associated with the initial lead-in is are not
counted. So to convert a LBA into an LSN you just add 150. Why the
distinction between LBA and LSN? I don't know, perhaps this has
something to do with "multisession" CDs.

---------- Footnotes ----------

(1) Perhaps this is a `libcdio' design flaw. It was originally done I
guess because it was convenient for VCDs.

The `libcdio' package comes with a number of small example programs in
the directory `example' which demonstrate different aspects of the
library and show how to use the library. The source code to all of the
examples here are contained on the package.

Other sources for examples would be the larger utility programs
`cd-drive', `cd-info', `cd-read', `iso-info', and `iso-read' which are
all in the `src' directory of the `libcdio' package.  See also *Note

File: libcdio.info,  Node: Example 1,  Next: Example 2,  Up: How to use

7.1 Example 1: list out tracks and LSNs
=======================================

Here we will give an annotated example which can be found in the
distribution as `example/tracks.c'.

 1: #include <stdio.h>
 2: #include <sys/types.h>
 3: #include <cdio/cdio.h>
 4: int
 5: main(int argc, const char *argv[])
 6: {
 7:  CdIo_t *p_cdio = cdio_open ("/dev/cdrom", DRIVER_DEVICE);
 8:  track_t first_track_num = cdio_get_first_track_num(p_cdio);
 9:  track_t i_tracks        = cdio_get_num_tracks(p_cdio);
10:  int j, i=first_track_num;
11:
12:  printf("CD-ROM Track List (%i - %i)\n", first_track_num, i_tracks);
13
14:  printf("  #:  LSN\n");
15:
16:  for (j = 0; j < i_tracks; i++, j++) {
17:    lsn_t lsn = cdio_get_track_lsn(p_cdio, i);
18:    if (CDIO_INVALID_LSN != lsn)
19:      printf("%3d: %06d\n", (int) i, lsn);
20:  }
21:  printf("%3X: %06d  leadout\n", CDIO_CDROM_LEADOUT_TRACK,
22:         cdio_get_track_lsn(p_cdio, CDIO_CDROM_LEADOUT_TRACK));
23:  cdio_destroy(p_cdio);
24:  return 0;
25: }

Already from the beginning on line 2 we see something odd. The
`#include <sys/types.h>' is needed because `libcdio' assumes type
definitions exist for `uint32_t', `uint16_t' and so on.  Alternatively
you change line 2 to:

#define HAVE_SYS_TYPES_H

and `<cdio/cdio.h>' will insert line 2. If you use GNU autoconf to
configure your program, add `sys/types.h' to `AC_HAVE_HEADERS' and _it_
will arrange for `HAVE_SYS_TYPES_H' to get defined. If you don't have
`<sys/types.h>' but have some other include that defines these types,
put that instead of line 2. Or you could roll your own typedefs. (Note:
In the future, this will probably get "fixed" by requiring glib.h.)

Okay after getting over the hurdle of line 2, the next line pretty
straightforward: you need to include this to get cdio definitions. One
of the types that is defined via line 3 is `CdIo_t' and a pointer that
is used pretty much in all operations. Line 6 initializes the variable
`cdio' which we will be using in all of the subsequent libcdio calls.
It does this via a call to `cdio_open()'.

The second parameter of `cdio_open' is DRIVER_UNKNOWN. For any given
installation a number of Compact Disc device drivers may be available.
In particular it's not uncommon to have several drivers that can read
CD disk-image formats as well as a driver that handles some CD-ROM
piece of hardware. Using DRIVER_UNKNOWN as that second parameter we let
the library select a driver amongst those that are available; generally
the first hardware driver that is available is the one selected.

If there is no CD in any of the CD-ROM drives or one does not have
access to the CD-ROM, it is possible that `libcdio' will find a CD
image in the directory you run this program and will pick a suitable
CD-image driver. If this is not what you want, but always want some
sort of CD-ROM driver (or failure if none), then use DRIVER_DEVICE
instead of DRIVER_UNKNOWN.

Note that in contrast to what is typically done using ioctls to read a
CD, you don't issue any sort of CD-ROM read TOC command--that is all
done by the driver. Of course, the information that you get from
reading the TOC is often desired: many tracks are on the CD, or what
number the first one is called. This is done through calls on lines 8
and 9.

For each track, we call a cdio routine to get the logical sector
number, `cdio_get_track_lsn()' on line 17 and print the track number
and LSN value. Finally we print out the "lead-out track" information
and we finally call `cdio_destroy()' in line 23 to indicate we're done
with the CD.

7.2 Example 2: list drivers available and default CD device
===========================================================

One thing that's a bit hoaky in Example 1 is hard-coding the name of
the device used: `/dev/cdrom'. Although often this is the name of a
CD-ROM device on GNU/Linux and possibly some other Unix derivatives,
there are many OSs for which use a different device name.

In the next example, we'll let the driver give us the name of the CD-ROM
device that is right for it.

 1: #include <stdio.h>
 2: #include <sys/types.h>
 3: #include <cdio/cdio.h>
 4: int
 5: main(int argc, const char *argv[])
 6: {
 7:   CdIo_t *p_cdio = cdio_open (NULL, DRIVER_DEVICE);
 8:   driver_id_t driver_id;
 9:
10:  if (NULL != p_cdio) {
11:    printf("The driver selected is %s\n", cdio_get_driver_name(p_cdio));
12:    printf("The default device for this driver is %s\n\n",
13:           cdio_get_default_device(p_cdio));
14:    cdio_destroy(p_cdio);
15:  } else {
16:    printf("Problem in trying to find a driver.\n\n");
17:  }
18:
19:  for (driver_id=CDIO_MIN_DRIVER; driver_id<=CDIO_MAX_DRIVER; driver_id++)
20:    if (cdio_have_driver(driver_id))
21:      printf("We have: %s\n", cdio_driver_describe(driver_id));
22:    else
23:      printf("We don't have: %s\n", cdio_driver_describe(driver_id));

Those who are die-hard cdparanoia programmers will notice that the
`libcdio' paranoia names are similar but a little bit different. In
particular instead of `paranoia_read' we have above
`cdio_paranoia_read' and instead of `cdda_open' we have
`cdio_cddap_open'.

This was done intentionally so that it is possible for the original
paranoia program can co-exist both in source code and linked libraries
and not conflict with `libcdio''s paranoia source and libraries.

In general in place of any paranoia routine that begins `paranoia_',
use `cdio_paranoia_' and in place of any paranoia routine that begins
`cdda_', use `cdio_cddap_'. But for a limited time `libcdio' will
accept the old paranoia names which may be useful for legacy paranoia
code. The way this magic works is by defining the old paranoia name to
be the `libcdio' name.

In the unusual case where you do want to use both the original paranoia
and `libcdio' routines in a single source, the C preprocessor symbol
`DO_NOT_WANT_PARANOIA_COMPATIBILITY' can be `define''d and this
disables the `#define' substitution done automatically. The may still
be a problem with conflicting structure definitions like
`cdrom_drive_t'.

`libcdio' library.

A larger more-complicated example are the `cd-drive', `cd-info',
`cd-read', `iso-info' and `iso-info' programs in the `src' directory.

Descriptions of the sample are as follows...

``cdchange.c''
     A program to test if a CD has been changed since the last change
     test.

``cdtext.c''
     A program to show CD-Text and CD disc mode info.

``drives.c''
     A program to show drivers installed and what the default CD-ROM
     drive is and what CD drives are available.

``eject.c''
     A program eject a CD from a CD-ROM drive and then close the door
     again.

``isolist.c''
     A program to show using `libiso9660' to list files in a
     directory of an ISO-9660 image.

``C++/isolist.cpp''
     The same program as `isolist.c' written in C++.

``iso2.c''
     A program to show using `libiso9660' to extract a file from a
     CDRWIN cue/bin CD image.

``C++/iso2.cpp''
     The same program as `iso2.c' written in C++.

``iso3.c''
     A program to show using libiso9660 to extract a file from an
     ISO-9660 image.

``C++/iso3.cpp''
     The same program as `iso3.c' written in C++.

``isofuzzy.c''
     A program showing fuzzy ISO-9660 detection/reading.

``mmc1.c''
     A program to show issuing a simple MMC command (`INQUIRY').

``C++/mmc1.cpp''
     The same program as `mmc1.c' written in C++.

``mmc2.c''
     A more involved MMC command to list CD and drive features from a
     SCSI-MMC `GET_CONFIGURATION' command.

``mmc2a.c''

     A program to show using libcdio's version of the CD-DA paranoia.

``paranoia2.c''
     A program to show using libcdio's version of the CD-DA paranoia
     library. But in this version, we'll open a cdio object before
     calling paranoia's open. I imagine in many cases such as media
     players this may be what will be done since, one may want to get
     CDDB/CD-Text info beforehand.

``tracks.c''
     A simple program to list track numbers and logical sector numbers
     of a Compact Disc using `libcdio'.

``sample2.c''
     A simple program to show drivers installed and what the default
     CD-ROM drive is.

``sample3.c''
     A simple program to show the use of `cdio_guess_cd_type()'.
     Figures out the kind of CD image we've got.

``sample4.c''
     A slightly improved sample3 program: we handle cdio logging and
     take an optional CD-location.

``udf1.c''
     A program to show using libudf to list files in a directory of an
     UDF image.

``udf2.c''
     A program to show using libudf to extract a file from an UDF image.

9.1 Multimedia Commands (MMC)
=============================

In contrast to the rest of the sections in this chapter, MMC
(Multimedia commands) is not a driver per se, although many of the
CD-ROM drivers do in fact issue MMC commands. MMC commands gives (in
theory) a broad and uniform way to access a CD-ROM drive.

If your CD-ROM drive understands MMC commands this is probably gives
the most flexibility in control. SCSI and ATAPI CD-ROM devices
generally support a fairly large set of MMC commands.

The name "SCSI MMC" is often found in the literature in specifications
and on the Internet. The "SCSI" part is probably a little bit
misleading because a drive can understand "SCSI MMC" commands but not
use a SCSI interface--ATAPI CD-ROMs are one such broad class of
examples. In fact there are drivers to "encapsulate" non-SCSI drives or
a non-MMC-compliant drives and make them act like MMC drives. I believe
that many OS SCSI "pass-through" mechanisms do roughly the same thing.

The name "SCSI MMC" is no doubt due to the fact that these commands
grew out of the SCSI command set and thus were bundled in them.

For clarity and precision we will use the term "MMC" rather than "SCSI
MMC".

One of the problems with MMC is that there are so many different
"standards". In particular there are MMC
`ftp://ftp.t10.org/t10/drafts/mmc/', MMC 2
`ftp://ftp.t10.org/t10/drafts/mmc2/', MMC 3
`ftp://ftp.t10.org/t10/drafts/mmc3/', MMC 4
`ftp://ftp.t10.org/t10/drafts/mmc4/', and MMC 5
`ftp://ftp.t10.org/t10/drafts/mmc5/' standards several "drafts" for
each standard. The good news about ATAPI drives is that they too
understand some sort of MMC subset. The bad news (as I understand it)
is that they do not understand any full MMC command set.

Another problem with the MMC commands related to the variations in
standards is the variation in the commands themselves and there are
perhaps two or three ways to do many of the basic commands like read a
CD frame.

There seems to be a fascination with the number of bytes a command
takes in the MMC-specification world. (Size matters?) So often the name
of an operation will have a suffix with the number of bytes of the
command (actually in MMC jargon this is called a "CDB" or command
descriptor block). So for example there is a 6-byte "MODE SELECT" often
called "MODE SELECT 6" and a 10-byte "MODE SELECT" often called "MODE
SELECT 10". Presumably the 6-byte command came first and it was
discovered that there was some deficiency causing the longer command.
In `libcdio' where there are two formats we add the suffix in the name,
e.g. `CDIO_MMC_GPCMD_MODE_SELECT_6' or `CDIO_MMC_GPCMD_MODE_SELECT_10'.

If the fascination and emphasis in the MMC specifications of CDB size
is a bit odd, equally so is the fact that this too often has bled
through at the OS programming API. However in `libcdio', you just give
the opcode in `scsi_mmc_run_cmd()' and we'll do the work to figure out
how many bytes of the CDB are used.

Down the line it is hoped that `libcdio' will have a way to remove a
distinction between the various alternative and alternative-size MMC
commands. In `cdio/scsi-mmc.h' you will find a little bit of this for
example via the routine `scsi_mmc_get_drive_cap()'. However much more
work is needed.

9.2 GNU/Linux
=============

The GNU/Linux uses a hybrid of methods. Somethings are done vai ioctl
and some things via MMC. GNU/Linux has a rather nice and complete ioctl
mechanism. On the other hand, the MMC mechanism is more universal.
There are other "access modes" listed which are not really access modes
and should probably be redone/rethought.  They are just different ways
to run the read command. But for completeness These are "READ_CD" and
"READ_10".

9.3 Microsoft Windows ioctl and ASPI
====================================

There are two CD drive access methods on Microsoft Windows platforms:
ioctl and ASPI.

The ASPI interface specification was developed by Adaptec for sending
commands to a SCSI host adapter (such as those controlling CD and DVD
drives) and used on Window 9x/NT and later. Emulation for ATAPI drives
was added so that the same sets of commands worked those even though
the drives might not be SCSI nor might there even be a SCSI controller
attached.

However in Windows NT/2K/XP, Microsoft provides their Win32 ioctl
interface, and has taken steps to make using ASPI more inaccessible
(e.g. requiring administrative access to use ASPI).

9.4 Solaris ATAPI and SCSI
==========================

There is currently only one CD drive access methods in Solaris: SCSI
(called "USCSI" or "user SCSI" in Solaris). There used to be an ATAPI
method and it could be resurrected if needed. USCSI was preferred since
on newer releases of Solaris and Solaris environments one would needs
to have root access for ATAPI.


File: libcdio.info,  Node: FreeBSD,  Next: OS X,  Prev: Solaris,  Up: CD-ROM Access and Drivers

9.5 FreeBSD ioctl and CAM
=========================

There are two CD drive access methods on Solaris: ioctl and CAM (common
access method). CAM is preferred when possible, especially on newer
releases. However CAM is right now sort of a hybrid and includes some
ioctl code.

More work on this driver is needed. Volunteers?


File: libcdio.info,  Node: OS X,  Prev: FreeBSD,  Up: CD-ROM Access and Drivers

9.6 OS X (non-exclussive access)
================================

A problem with OS/X is that if the OS thinks it understands the drive
it gains exclusive access to it and thus prevents a library like this
to get non-exclusive access.

Currently `libcdio' access the CD-ROM non-exclusively. However in order
to be able to issue MMC, the current belief is that exclusive access is
needed. Probably in a future `libcdio', there will be some way to
specify which kind of access is desired (with the inherent consequences
of each).

More work on this driver is needed. Volunteers?

10 Internal Program Organization
********************************

10.0.1 file organization
------------------------

Here is a list of `libcdio' directories.

   * `include/cdio'

     This contains the headers that are public. One that will probably
     be used quite a bit is `<cdio/cdio.h>'.

   * `lib'

     Code for installed libraries. See below for further breakout

   * `lib/driver'

     Code for various OS-specific CD-ROM drivers, image drivers, and
     common MMC routines.

     This code comprises `libcdio.a' (or the shared version of it).

   * `lib/iso9660'

     Code for to extract or query ISO-9660 images.

     This code comprises `libiso9660.a' (or the shared version of it).

   * `lib/paranoia'

     This is from cdparanoia. It is the OS- and hardware- dependent
     code to detect and correct jitter for CD-DA CDs.

   * `lib/cdda_interface'

     This is also from cdparanoia. It is the OS- and hardware-
     independent code to detect and correct jitter for CD-DA CDs.

   * `doc'

     A home for fine documentation such as this masterpiece.

   * `example'

     Here you will find various small example programs using `libcdio'
     which are largely for pedagogical purposes. You might be able to
     find one that is similar to what you want to do that could be
     extended. In fact some these are contain the kernel ideas behind of
     some of the larger programs in `src'.

   * `src'

     Various stand-alone utility programs. See below.

   * `src/paranoia'

     `libcdio''s version of `cdparanoia'. Except for the fact that the
     back-end CD-reading code has been replaced by `libcdio''s routines
     the code is pretty much identical.

   * `test'

     Regression tests


10.0.2 `libcdio'
----------------

`libcdio' exports one opaque type `CdIo_t'. Internally this a structure
containing an enumeration for the driver, a structure containing
function pointers and a generic "environment" pointer which is passed
as a parameter on a function call. See `lib/driver/cdio_private.h'. The
initialization routine for each driver sets up the function pointers
and allocates memory for the environment. When a particular user-level
cdio routine is called (e.g `cdio_get_first_track_num' for
lib/driver/track.c), the environment pointer is passed to a
device-specific routine which will then cast this pointer into
something of the appropriate type.

Because function pointers are used, there can be and is quite a bit of
sharing of common routines. Some of the common routines are found in
the file `lib/driver/_cdio_generic.c'.

Another set of routines that one is likely to find shared amongst
drivers are the MMC commands. These are located in
`lib/driver/scsi_mmc.c'.

There is not only an attempt to share functions but we've tried to
create a generic CD structure `generic_img_private_t' of file
`lib/driver/generic.h'. By putting information into a common structure,
we increase the likelihood of being able to have a common routine to
perform some sort of function.

The generic CD structure would also be useful in a utility to convert
one CD-image format to another. Basically the first image format is
"parsed" into the common internal format and then from this structure
it is unparsed.

10.0.3 `libiso9660'
-------------------

To be completed....

10.0.4 Coding Conventions
-------------------------

In `libcdio' there are a number of conventions used. If you understand
some of these conventions it may facilitate understanding the code a
little.

10.0.4.1 namespace names
........................

For the most part, the visible external `libcdio' names follow
conventions so as not to be confused with other applications or
libraries. If you understand these conventions, there will be little or
no chance that the names you use will conflict with `libcdio' and
`libiso9660' and vice versa.

All of the external `libcdio' C routines start out with `cdio_', e.g.
`cdio_open'; as a corollary, the `libcdio' CD-Paranoia routines start
`cdio_cddap_', e.g. `cdio_cddap_open'.  `libiso9660' routines start
`iso9660_', e.g. `iso9660_open'.

`libcdio' C-Preprocessor names generally start `CDIO_', for example
`CDIO_CD_FRAMESIZE_RAW'; `libiso9660' C-preprocessor names start
`ISO9660_', e.g. `ISO9660_FRAMESIZE'.

10.0.4.2 suffixes (type and structure names)
............................................

A few suffixes are used in type and structure names:

   * `_e'

     An enumeration tag. Generally though the same name will appear
     with the `_t' suffix and probably that should be used instead.

   * `_s'

     A structure tag. Generally though the same name will appear with
     the `_t' suffix and probably that should be used instead.

   * `_t'

     A type suffix.


10.0.4.3 prefixes (variable names)
..................................

A number of prefixes are used in variable names here's what they mean

   * `i_'

     An integer type of some sort. A variable of this ilk one might find
     being iterated over in `for' loops or used as the index of an
     array for example.

   * `b_'

     A boolean type of some sort. A variable of this ilk one might find
     being in an `if' condition for example.

   * `p_'

     A pointer of some sort. A variable of this ilk, say `p_foo' one is
     like likely to see `*p_foo' or `p_foo->...'.

   * `pp_'

     A pointer to a pointer of some sort. A variable of this ilk, say
     `pp_foo' one is like likely to see `**p_foo' or `p_foo[x][y]' for
     example

   * `psz_'

     A `char *' pointer of some sort. A variable of this ilk, say
     `psz_foo' may be used in a string operation. For example
     `printf(%s\n", psz_foo)' or `strdup(psz_foo)'.

   * `ppsz_'

     A pointer to a `char *' pointer of some sort. A variable of this
     ilk, say `ppsz_foo' is used for example to return a list of CD-ROM
     device names


There are a some other naming conventions. Generally if a routine name
starts `cdio_', e.g. `cdio_open', then it is an externally visible
routine in `libcdio'. If a name starts `iso9660_', e.g.
`iso9660_is_dchar' then it is an externally visible routine in
`libiso9660'. If a name starts `scsi_mmc_', e.g.
`scsi_mmc_get_discmode', then it is an externally visible MMC routine.
(We don't have a separate library for this yet.

Names using entirely capital letters and that start `CDIO_' are
externally visible `#defines'.

See also `http://www.dvdrhelp.com/glossary'.

"ASPI"
     See Win32 ASPI

"ATA"
     Advanced Technology Attachment (ATA). The same things as IDE.

"ATAPI"
     Advanced Technology Attachment (ATA) Packet Interface. The
     interface provides a mechanism for transferring and executing SCSI
     CDBs on IDE CD Drives and DVD Drives.

     IDE (also called ATA) was originally designed for hard drives only,
     but with help of ATAPI it is possible to connect other devices, in
     particular CD-ROMS to the IDE/EIDE connections.

     The ATAPI CD-ROM drives understand a subset of MMC commands. In
     particular multi-initiator commands are neither needed nor deviced
     for ATAPI devices.

"BIN/CUE"
     A CD-image format developed by Jeff Arnold for CDRWIN software on
     Microsoft Windows. Many other programs subsequently support using
     this format. The `.CUE' file is a text file which contains CD
     format and track layout information, while the `.BIN' file holds
     the actual data of each track.

"CD"
     Compact Disc

"CD-DA"
     Compact Disc Digital Audio, described in the "Red Book" or IEC
     60908 (formerly IEC 908). This commonly referred to as an audio CD
     and what most people think of when you play a CD as it was the
     first to use the CD medium.

     See `http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Book_(audio_CD_standard)'

"CD+G"
     Compact Disc + Graphics. An extension of the CD audio format
     contains a limited amount of graphics in subcode channels. This
     disc works in all audio players but the graphics portion is only
     available in a special CD+G or Karaoke player.

"CD-i"
     Compact Disc Interactive. An extension of the CD format designed
     around a set-top computer that connects to a TV to provide
     interactive home entertainment, including digital audio and video,
     video games, and software applications. Defined by the "Green
     Book" standard.  `http://www.icdia.org/'. CD-i for video and video
     music has largely (if not totally) been superceded by VCDs.

"CD-i Bridge"
     A standard allowing CD-ROM XA discs to play on CD-i.  Kodak
     PhotoCDs are CD-XA Bridge discs.

"CD-ROM"
     Compact Disc Read Only Memory or "Yellow Book" describe in
     Standards ISO/IEC 10149. The data stored on it can be either in
     the form of audio, computer or video files.

"CD-ROM Mode 1 and Mode2"
     The Yellow Book specifies two types of tracks, Mode 1 and Mode 2.
     Mode 1 is used for computer data and text and has an extra error
     correction layer. Mode 2 is for audio and video data and has no
     extra correction layer. CD-ROM/XA An expansion of the CD-ROM Mode
     2 format that allows both computer and audio/video to be mixed in
     the same track.

"CD Text"
     CD Text is a technology developed by Sony Corporation and Philips
     Electronics in 1996 that allows storing in an audio CD and its
     tracks information such as artist name, title, songwriter,
     composer, or arranger. Commercially available audio CDs sometimes
     contain CD Text information.

"CD XA"
     CD-ROM EXtended Architecture. A modification to the CD-ROM
     specification that defines two new types of sectors.  CD-ROM XA was
     developed jointly by Sony, Philips, and Microsoft, and announced in
     August 1988. Its specifications were published in an extension to
     the Yellow Book.  CD-i, Photo CD, Video CD and CD-EXTRA have all
     subsequently been based on CD-ROM XA.

     CD-XA defines another way of formatting sectors on a CD-ROM,
     including headers in the sectors that describe the type (audio,
     video, data) and some additional info (markers, resolution in case
     of a video or audio sector, file numbers, etc).

     The data written on a CD-XA is consistent with and can be in
     ISO-9660 file system format and therefore be readable by ISO-9660
     file system translators. But also a CD-I player can also read
     CD-XA discs even if its own `Green Book' file system only
     resembles ISO 9660 and isn't fully compatible.

"Command Packet"
     The data structure that is used to issue an ATAPI command. The same
     thing as a SCSI Command Descriptor Block (CDB).

"FSF"
     Free Software Foundation, `http://www.fsf.org/'

"GNU"
     GNU is not UNIX, `http://www.gnu.org/'

"IDE"
     Integrated Drive Electronics. This is a commonly used interface for
     hard disk drives and CD-ROM drives. It is less expensive than SCSI,
     but offers slightly less in terms of performance.

"ISO"
     International Standards Organization.

"ISO 9660"
     The ISO 9660 is an operating-system independent filesystem format
     for CD-ROM media and DVD-ROMs. It was standardized in 1988 and
     replaced the High Sierra standard for the logical format on CD-ROM
     media (ISO 9660 and High Sierra are identical in content, but the
     exact format is different).

     There are several specification levels. In Level 1, file names
     must be in the 8.3 format (no more than eight characters in the
     name, no more than three characters in the suffix) and in capital
     letters. Directory names can be no longer than eight characters.
     There can be no more than eight nested directory levels. Level 2
     and 3 specifications allow file names up to 32 characters long.

     ECMA-119
     (`http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-119.htm'
     is the European specification which is identical to ISO 9660.  ISO
     13490 is basically ISO 9660 with multisession support.

"Joliet extensions"
     This ISO-9660 upward-compatible standard was developed for Windows
     95 and Windows NT by Microsoft as an extension of ISO 9600 which
     allows the use of Unicode characters and supports file names up to
     64 characters.

     See `http://bmrc.berkeley.edu/people/chaffee/jolspec.html' for the
     Joliet Specification.

     The name Joliet comes from the city in Illinois (U.S) that the
     standard was defined.

"LBA"
     Logical Block Addressing. Mapped integer numbers from CD Red Book
     Addressing MSF.  The starting sector is -150 and ending sector is
     449849, which correlates directly to MSF: 00:00:00 to 99:59:74.
     Because an LBA is a single number it is often easier to work with
     in programming than an MSF.

"Lead in"
     The area of a CD where the Table Of Contents (TOC) and CD Text are
     stored.  I think it is supposed to be around 4500 (1 min) or more
     sectors in length.  On a CDR(W) the lead-in length is variable,
     because each manufacturer will have a different starting position
     indicated by the ATIP start of lead-in position that is recorded in
     the ATIP groove on the disk.

"LSN"
     Logical Sector Number. Mapped integer numbers from CD Red Book
     Addressing MSF.  The starting sector is 0 and ending sector is
     449699, which correlates to MSF: 00:00:00 to 99:59:74.  Because an
     LSN is a single number it is often easier to work with in
     programming than an MSF. Because it starts at 0 rather than -150
     as is the case of an LBA it can be represented as an unsigned
     value.

"MCN"
     Media Catalog Number. A identification number on an audio CD.  Also
     called a UPC. Another identification number is ISRC.

"MMC"
     MMC (Multimedia Commands). A SCSI programming specification made by
     the SCSI committee T10 organization `http://www.t10.org/'.  MMC
     are raw commands for communicating with CDROM drives, CD-Rewriters,
     DVD-Rewriters, etc.

     Many manufacturers have adopted this standard and it also applies
     to ATAPI versions of their drives.

"Mixed Mode CD"
     A Mixed Mode is a CD that contains tracks of differing CD-ROM Mode
     formats. In particular the first track may contain both computer
     data (Yellow Book) CD ROM data while the remaining tracks are
     audio or video data. Video CD's can be Mixed Mode CDs.

"Multisession"
     A way of writing to a CD that allows more data to be added to
     readable discs at a later time.

"Nero NRG format file"
     A proprietary CD image file format use by a popular program for
     Microsoft Windows, Ahead Nero. The specification of this format is
     not to our knowlege published.

"Rock Ridge Extensions"
     An extension to the ISO-9660 standard which adds POSIX information
     to files.

"SCSI"
     Small Computer System Interface.  A set of ANSI standard electronic
     interfaces (originally developed at Apple Computer) that allow
     personal computers to communicate with peripheral hardware such as
     CD-ROM drives, disk drives, printers, etc.

"SCSI CDB"
     SCSI Command Descriptor Block. The data structure that is used to
     issue a SCSI command.

"SCSI Pass Through Interface."
     Yet another way of issuing MMC commands for accessing a CD-ROM. As
     with MMC or ASPI, the CD-ROM doesn't necessarily have to be a
     SCSI-attached drive. See also MMC and ASPI.

"Session"
     A fully readable complete recording that contains one or more
     tracks of computer data or audio on a CD.

"SVCD"
     Super VCD

     An improvement of Video CD 2.0 specification which includes most
     notably a switch from MPEG-1 (constant bit rate encoding) to
     MPEG-2 (variable bit rate encoding) for the video stream.

     Also added was higher video-stream resolution, up to 4 overlay
     graphics and text ("OGT") sub-channels for user switchable
     subtitle displaying, closed caption text, and command lists for
     controlling the SVCD virtual machine.

     See `http://www.dvdrhelp.com/svcd'

"TOC"
     (Compact Disc) Table of Contents. The TOC contains the starting
     track number, last track number individual track starting time,
     and some track flags (copy protection, linear audio preemphasis,
     track format: CDDA or data).  Every CD must have at least 1 TOC,
     the first TOC is always recorded at the start of the CD (lead-in
     area).  A multi-session CD may have several TOCs.

"Track"
     A unit of data of a CD. The size of a track can vary; it can occupy
     the entire contents of the CD. Most CD standards however require
     that tracks have a 150 frame (or "2 second") lead-in gap.

"VCD"
     The Video Compact Disc ("Video CD" or "VCD") is a standardized
     digital video storage format. It is based on the commonly available
     Compact Disc technology, which allows for low-cost video authoring.
     Video CD's can be played in most DVD standalone player, dedicated
     VCD players and finally, modern Personal Computers with multimedia
     support.

     A Video CD is made up of CD-ROM XA sectors, i.e. CD-ROM mode 2
     form 1 & 2 sectors. Non-MPEG data is stored in mode 2 form 1
     sectors with a user data area of 2048 byte, which have a similiar
     L2 error correction and detection (ECC/EDC) to CD-ROM mode 1
     sectors. While realtime MPEG streams is stored in CD-ROM mode 2
     form 2 sectors, which by have no L2 ECC, yield a ~14% greater user
     data area consisting of 2324 bytes(1)

     `http://www.dvdrhelp.com/vcd'

"Win32 ASPI"
     The ASPI interface specification was developed by Adaptec for
     sending commands to a SCSI host adapter (such as those controlling
     CD and DVD drives) and used on Window 9x/NT and later. Emulation
     for ATAPI drives was added so that the same sets of commands
     worked those even though the drives might not be SCSI nor might
     there even be a SCSI controller attached.

     However in Windows NT/2K/XP, Microsoft provides their Win32 ioctl
     interface, and has take steps to make using ASPI more inaccessible
     (e.g. requiring adminstrative access to use ASPI).

     See also MMC

"Win32 ioctl driver"
     Ioctl (Input Output ConTroLs). A Win32 function, implemented in all
     Microsoft Windows.  It is used for sending commands to devices
     using defined codes and structures.

"XA"
     See CD-ROM XA


---------- Footnotes ----------

(1) actually raw mode 2 sectors have a 2336 byte user data area, but
parts of it are used for error codes and headers when using the mode 2
form 1 or form 2 configurations.

General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
your programs, too.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.
Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have
the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this
service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone
to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.  These
restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis
or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you
have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.

We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the software.

Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
authors' reputations.

Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents.
We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will
individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program
proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent
must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a
     notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
     under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program",
     below, refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on
     the Program" means either the Program or any derivative work under
     copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Program or a
     portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or
     translated into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is
     included without limitation in the term "modification".)  Each
     licensee is addressed as "you".

     Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are
     not covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act
     of running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the
     Program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on
     the Program (independent of having been made by running the
     Program).  Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.

  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
     source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
     conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
     copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
     notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
     warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of
     this License along with the Program.

     You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
     and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange
     for a fee.

  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
     of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
     distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
     above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

       a. You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

       b. You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that
          in whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program
          or any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge
          to all third parties under the terms of this License.

       c. If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
          when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
          interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display
          an announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and
          a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you
          provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the
          program under these conditions, and telling the user how to
          view a copy of this License.  (Exception: if the Program
          itself is interactive but does not normally print such an
          announcement, your work based on the Program is not required
          to print an announcement.)

     These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
     identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the
     Program, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate
     works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not
     apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate
     works.  But when you distribute the same sections as part of a
     whole which is a work based on the Program, the distribution of
     the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions
     for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each
     and every part regardless of who wrote it.

     Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or
     contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the
     intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of
     derivative or collective works based on the Program.

     In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the
     Program with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on
     a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the
     other work under the scope of this License.

  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
     under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms
     of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the
     following:

       a. Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
          source code, which must be distributed under the terms of
          Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for
          software interchange; or,

       b. Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
          years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
          cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
          machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
          distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
          medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

       c. Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
          to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
          allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
          received the program in object code or executable form with
          such an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)

     The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
     making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete
     source code means all the source code for all modules it contains,
     plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts
     used to control compilation and installation of the executable.
     However, as a special exception, the source code distributed need
     not include anything that is normally distributed (in either
     source or binary form) with the major components (compiler,
     kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable
     runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable.

     If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
     access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
     access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
     distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
     compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
     except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
     otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
     void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this
     License.  However, parties who have received copies, or rights,
     from you under this License will not have their licenses
     terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
     signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify
     or distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions
     are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.
     Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or any work
     based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this
     License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying,
     distributing or modifying the Program or works based on it.

  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
     Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
     original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program
     subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any
     further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights
     granted herein.  You are not responsible for enforcing compliance
     by third parties to this License.

  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
     infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent
     issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order,
     agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this
     License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this
     License.  If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously
     your obligations under this License and any other pertinent
     obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the
     Program at all.  For example, if a patent license would not permit
     royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who
     receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only
     way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain
     entirely from distribution of the Program.

     If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable
     under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is
     intended to apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply
     in other circumstances.

     It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
     patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of
     any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting
     the integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
     implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
     generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
     through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
     system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is
     willing to distribute software through any other system and a
     licensee cannot impose that choice.

     This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed
     to be a consequence of the rest of this License.

  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
     certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces,
     the original copyright holder who places the Program under this
     License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation
     excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only
     in or among countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this
     License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of
     this License.

  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
     versions of the General Public License from time to time.  Such
     new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but
     may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

     Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the
     Program specifies a version number of this License which applies
     to it and "any later version", you have the option of following
     the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later
     version published by the Free Software Foundation.  If the Program
     does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose
     any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

 10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
     programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the
     author to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted
     by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software
     Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our decision
     will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of
     all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
     and reuse of software generally.

                                NO WARRANTY
 11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
     WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE
     LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
     HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT
     WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT
     NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND
     FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE
     QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
     PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY
     SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

 12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
     WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY
     MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE
     LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL,
     INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR
     INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF
     DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU
     OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY
     OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN
     ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

                      END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
Appendix: How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
=======================================================

If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these
terms.

To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest to
attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey
the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
"copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

ONE LINE TO GIVE THE PROGRAM'S NAME AND A BRIEF IDEA OF WHAT IT DOES.
Copyright (C) YYYY  NAME OF AUTHOR

This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
(at your option) any later version.

This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
GNU General Public License for more details.

You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place - Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307, USA.

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
when it starts in an interactive mode:

Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) 19YY NAME OF AUTHOR
Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.

The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the
appropriate parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the
commands you use may be called something other than `show w' and `show
c'; they could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your
program.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:

Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program
`Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.

SIGNATURE OF TY COON, 1 April 1989
Ty Coon, President of Vice

This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program
into proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library,
you may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary
applications with the library.  If this is what you want to do, use the
GNU Library General Public License instead of this License.

Appendix D GNU Free Documentation License
*****************************************

                        Version 1.1, March 2000

Copyright (C) 2000 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307, USA

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

  0. PREAMBLE

     The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
     written document "free" in the sense of freedom: to assure everyone
     the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it, with or without
     modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially.  Secondarily,
     this License preserves for the author and publisher a way to get
     credit for their work, while not being considered responsible for
     modifications made by others.

     This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative
     works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.
     It complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
     license designed for free software.

     We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for
     free software, because free software needs free documentation: a
     free program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms
     that the software does.  But this License is not limited to
     software manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless
     of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed book.
     We recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is
     instruction or reference.

  1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

     This License applies to any manual or other work that contains a
     notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed
     under the terms of this License.  The "Document", below, refers to
     any such manual or work.  Any member of the public is a licensee,
     and is addressed as "you".

     A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the
     Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
     modifications and/or translated into another language.

     A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter
     section of the Document that deals exclusively with the
     relationship of the publishers or authors of the Document to the
     Document's overall subject (or to related matters) and contains
     nothing that could fall directly within that overall subject.
     (For example, if the Document is in part a textbook of
     mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any mathematics.)
     The relationship could be a matter of historical connection with
     the subject or with related matters, or of legal, commercial,
     philosophical, ethical or political position regarding them.

     The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose
     titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in
     the notice that says that the Document is released under this
     License.

     The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are
     listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice
     that says that the Document is released under this License.

     A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
     represented in a format whose specification is available to the
     general public, whose contents can be viewed and edited directly
     and straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images
     composed of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some
     widely available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to
     text formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of
     formats suitable for input to text formatters.  A copy made in an
     otherwise Transparent file format whose markup has been designed
     to thwart or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not
     Transparent.  A copy that is not "Transparent" is called "Opaque".

     Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
     ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format,
     SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and
     standard-conforming simple HTML designed for human modification.
     Opaque formats include PostScript, PDF, proprietary formats that
     can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML
     or XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally
     available, and the machine-generated HTML produced by some word
     processors for output purposes only.

     The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
     plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the
     material this License requires to appear in the title page.  For
     works in formats which do not have any title page as such, "Title
     Page" means the text near the most prominent appearance of the
     work's title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

  2. VERBATIM COPYING

     You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
     commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
     copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License
     applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you
     add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You
     may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading
     or further copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However,
     you may accept compensation in exchange for copies.  If you
     distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow
     the conditions in section 3.

     You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above,
     and you may publicly display copies.

  3. COPYING IN QUANTITY

     If you publish printed copies of the Document numbering more than
     100, and the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you
     must enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly,
     all these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and
     Back-Cover Texts on the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly
     and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies.  The
     front cover must present the full title with all words of the
     title equally prominent and visible.  You may add other material
     on the covers in addition.  Copying with changes limited to the
     covers, as long as they preserve the title of the Document and
     satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in
     other respects.

     If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
     legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
     reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto
     adjacent pages.

     If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document
     numbering more than 100, you must either include a
     machine-readable Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or
     state in or with each Opaque copy a publicly-accessible
     computer-network location containing a complete Transparent copy
     of the Document, free of added material, which the general
     network-using public has access to download anonymously at no
     charge using public-standard network protocols.  If you use the
     latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you
     begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that
     this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated
     location until at least one year after the last time you
     distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or
     retailers) of that edition to the public.

     It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of
     the Document well before redistributing any large number of
     copies, to give them a chance to provide you with an updated
     version of the Document.

  4. MODIFICATIONS

     You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document
     under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you
     release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with
     the Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus
     licensing distribution and modification of the Modified Version to
     whoever possesses a copy of it.  In addition, you must do these
     things in the Modified Version:

       A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title
          distinct from that of the Document, and from those of
          previous versions (which should, if there were any, be listed
          in the History section of the Document).  You may use the
          same title as a previous version if the original publisher of
          that version gives permission.

       B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or
          entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in
          the Modified Version, together with at least five of the
          principal authors of the Document (all of its principal
          authors, if it has less than five).

       C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
          Modified Version, as the publisher.

       D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.

       E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
          adjacent to the other copyright notices.

       F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license
          notice giving the public permission to use the Modified
          Version under the terms of this License, in the form shown in
          the Addendum below.

       G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant
          Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document's
          license notice.

       H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.

       I. Preserve the section entitled "History", and its title, and
          add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new
          authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on
          the Title Page.  If there is no section entitled "History" in
          the Document, create one stating the title, year, authors,
          and publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page,
          then add an item describing the Modified Version as stated in
          the previous sentence.

       J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document
          for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and
          likewise the network locations given in the Document for
          previous versions it was based on.  These may be placed in
          the "History" section.  You may omit a network location for a
          work that was published at least four years before the
          Document itself, or if the original publisher of the version
          it refers to gives permission.

       K. In any section entitled "Acknowledgments" or "Dedications",
          preserve the section's title, and preserve in the section all
          the substance and tone of each of the contributor
          acknowledgments and/or dedications given therein.

       L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,
          unaltered in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers
          or the equivalent are not considered part of the section
          titles.

       M. Delete any section entitled "Endorsements".  Such a section
          may not be included in the Modified Version.

       N. Do not retitle any existing section as "Endorsements" or to
          conflict in title with any Invariant Section.

     If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
     appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no
     material copied from the Document, you may at your option
     designate some or all of these sections as invariant.  To do this,
     add their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified
     Version's license notice.  These titles must be distinct from any
     other section titles.

     You may add a section entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains
     nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
     parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text
     has been approved by an organization as the authoritative
     definition of a standard.

     You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text,
     and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end
     of the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one
     passage of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be
     added by (or through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the
     Document already includes a cover text for the same cover,
     previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same entity
     you are acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may
     replace the old one, on explicit permission from the previous
     publisher that added the old one.

     The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this
     License give permission to use their names for publicity for or to
     assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version.

  5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS

     You may combine the Document with other documents released under
     this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for
     modified versions, provided that you include in the combination
     all of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents,
     unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your
     combined work in its license notice.

     The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
     multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
     copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name
     but different contents, make the title of each such section unique
     by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the
     original author or publisher of that section if known, or else a
     unique number.  Make the same adjustment to the section titles in
     the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the
     combined work.

     In the combination, you must combine any sections entitled
     "History" in the various original documents, forming one section
     entitled "History"; likewise combine any sections entitled
     "Acknowledgments", and any sections entitled "Dedications".  You
     must delete all sections entitled "Endorsements."

  6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

     You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other
     documents released under this License, and replace the individual
     copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy
     that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the
     rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the
     documents in all other respects.

     You may extract a single document from such a collection, and
     distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert
     a copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow
     this License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of
     that document.

  7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

     A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other
     separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of
     a storage or distribution medium, does not as a whole count as a
     Modified Version of the Document, provided no compilation
     copyright is claimed for the compilation.  Such a compilation is
     called an "aggregate", and this License does not apply to the
     other self-contained works thus compiled with the Document, on
     account of their being thus compiled, if they are not themselves
     derivative works of the Document.

     If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
     copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one
     quarter of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be
     placed on covers that surround only the Document within the
     aggregate.  Otherwise they must appear on covers around the whole
     aggregate.

  8. TRANSLATION

     Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
     distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section
     4.  Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
     permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
     translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
     original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
     translation of this License provided that you also include the
     original English version of this License.  In case of a
     disagreement between the translation and the original English
     version of this License, the original English version will prevail.

  9. TERMINATION

     You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
     except as expressly provided for under this License.  Any other
     attempt to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Document is
     void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this
     License.  However, parties who have received copies, or rights,
     from you under this License will not have their licenses
     terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

 10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

     The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of
     the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
     versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
     differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
     `http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/'.

     Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version
     number.  If the Document specifies that a particular numbered
     version of this License "or any later version" applies to it, you
     have the option of following the terms and conditions either of
     that specified version or of any later version that has been
     published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.  If
     the Document does not specify a version number of this License,
     you may choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the
     Free Software Foundation.

ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents
====================================================

To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
the License in the document and put the following copyright and license
notices just after the title page:

  Copyright (C)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.
  Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
  under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.1
  or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
  with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with the
  Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts being LIST.
  A copy of the license is included in the section entitled ``GNU
  Free Documentation License''.

If you have no Invariant Sections, write "with no Invariant Sections"
instead of saying which ones are invariant.  If you have no Front-Cover
Texts, write "no Front-Cover Texts" instead of "Front-Cover Texts being
LIST"; likewise for Back-Cover Texts.

If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of
free software license, such as the GNU General Public License, to
permit their use in free software.
