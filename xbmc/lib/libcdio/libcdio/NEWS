version 0.80
2008-03-15

- Add get_media_changed for FreeBSD
- Add option to log summary output in cd-paranoia
- More string bounds checking to eliminate known string overflow conditions,
  e.g. Savannah bug #21910
- add --mode="any" on cd-read which uses a mmc_read_sectors with read-type
       CDIO_MMC_READ_TYPE_ANY.
- add --log-summary option to cd-paranoia. Unused option --output-info (-i) removed
- some small packaging bugs fixed

Note: this is probably the last GPL v2 release; GPL v3 on the horizon.

version 0.79
2007-10-27

- iso-read: Add --ignore -k to ignore errors. 

- Fix Savannah Bugs #18522, #18563, #18131 #19221 (possibly), #19880,
  #21147 and other miscelleaneous bugs and memory leaks

- cd-info: force CDDB disc id to be 32-bits. Problem reported 
           by Eric Shattow.
- cd-paranoia: allow ripping before the first track. Problem reported 
               by Eric Shattow.
- Support for multisession CD-Extra Discs - via of Patrick Guimond

- Add iso9660_fs_find_lsn_with_path and iso9660_ifs_find_lsn_with_path
  to report the full filename path of lsn.

- improve eject code for OSX

version 0.78.2
2006-10-31
- preprocessor symbol LIBCDIO_VERSION number has to be an integer.
  (Bug caused by naming version 0.78.1)
                                     ^

version 0.78.1
2006-10-27

- Fix bug in libcdio.so version numbering. Also another small bug.
  Thanks to Janos Farkas 

version 0.78
2006-10-27
=====================================
- add mmc-tool
- add mmc-close-tray
- libudf: can now read (extract) file data, at least for ICB strategy 
          type 4.
- libcdio is starting to get updated for UTF-8 support. Strings,
  which are guaranteed to be in UTF-8, are returned as a new type
  cdio_utf8_t, which is typedef'd to char.
- fixes to eject. On GNU/Linux we unmount filesystems first.
  
version 0.77
=====================================
2006-03-17

- Add an object-oriented C++ wrapper. (libcdio++ and libiso9660++)

- replace libpopt with getopt in cd-drive, cd-info, iso-info, iso-read
  (Peter J. Creath)

- Document cd-paranoia (Peter J. Creath)

- Add cdio_eject_media_drive().

- Add more generic read_sectors() 

- Document that NULL also uses default drive in close_tray, cdio_open
  and cdio_open_am. Document b_mode2 paramenter not used in cdio ISO
  read.

- Some provision for handling Rock-Ridge device numbers.

- block read routines return success if asked to read 0 blocks.

- Start UDF handling

- increase use of enumerations more and decrease use of #defines

- OS Support: 
    DragonFly recognized as FreeBSD, 
    MinGW better tolerated,
    GNU/Linux (and others?) LARGEFILE support
    OpenBSD tested (no native CD driver though)

- Doxygen formatting improvements.

- Misc bugs: 
  * fixed bincue driver caused core dump on set_speed and 
    set_blocksize; it also called the wrong routine (from NRG) to get a
    list of cd-images. 
  * read.h didn't make sure off_t was defined. 
  * fixed bug in is_device() when driver_id = DRIVER_UNKNOWN or DRIVER_DEVICE.
  * OSX was freeing too much in listing drives. 
  * get_hwinfo was not respecting fixed-length field boundaries in 
    image drivers (strcpy->strncpy).
  * A number ISO 9660 time conversion routines corrected with respect to
    various timezone offsets, daylight savings time, and tm capabilities

- small cdda-player improvements - shows more CD-TEXT, and fix bug in
  non-interactive use (Yes, I sometimes use it.)

- NRG checking parses file. string tests were invalid on short < 4
  character filenames.

- Revise and improve example programs

- Security: replace all uses of strcat and strcpy with strncat and strncpy

version 0.76
=====================================
2005-09-23

- Better compatibility with C++

  doesn't have it, e.g. MSYS 1.0.10 with MinGW 3.4.2.

- Allow building cd-paranoia if Perl is not installed.

- More accurate library dependency tracking in linking and pkg-config 

- Miscellaneous minor bug fixes.

- cdio/cdda.h headers no longer depends on cdio/paranoia.h but vice versa
  is true. This may require an #include <cdio/cdda.h> in some applications that
  used <cdio/paranoia.h> but didn't include it.

-  cd-info: now displays date on iso9660 listing and translates filename 
   to normal conventions, gives track "green" info
