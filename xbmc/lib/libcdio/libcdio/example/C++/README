This directory contains some simple C++ examples of the use of the libcdio
library.

Descriptions of the programs in this example directory are as follows...

device.cpp: A program to show drivers installed and what the default
	    CD-ROM drive is and what CD drives are available.

eject.cpp:  A program eject a CD from a CD-ROM drive and then close the door
	    again.

isofile.cpp:  A program to show using libiso9660 to extract a file from an
	      ISO-9660 image.

isofile2.cpp: A program to show using libiso9660 to extract a file
	      from a CDRWIN cue/bin CD image.

isolist.cpp:   A program to show using libiso9660 to list files in a
	       directory of an ISO-9660 image and give basic iso9660 
	       information.

mmc1.cpp:   A program to show issuing a simple MMC command (INQUIRY).

mmc2.cpp:   A more involved MMC command to list features from 
	    a MMC GET_CONFIGURATION command.

paranoia.cpp: A program to show using CD-DA paranoia (a library for jitter
	      detection and audio-read error correction). This program uses
	      an interface compatible (mostly) with cdparanoia.

paranoia2.cpp: Another program to show using CD-DA paranoia using a more
	       libcdio-oriented initialization. Probably more suited to
	       things that otherwise use libcdio such as media players 
	       (e.g. for getting CDDB or CD-Text info)
