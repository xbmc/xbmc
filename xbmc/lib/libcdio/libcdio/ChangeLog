	  that are not present in the system.

2007-11-16 Friday 21:46  Diego 'Flameeyes' Pettenò

	* lib/iso9660/iso9660.c: Do not assume that sizeof(int) ==
	  sizeof(long), the assumption is wrong on 64-bit arches. Reduce
	  the size of strtol range when filling a struct tm variable.

2007-11-16 Friday 21:31  Diego 'Flameeyes' Pettenò

	* lib/driver/utf8.c: Include config.h before checking for

	  contributed by Matt Messier. This allows to eject disks on Mac OS

	  src/cd-paranoia/doc/ja/cd-paranoia.1.in: Rename Japan locale to
	  ja. Bug #19880.

2007-04-15 Sunday 16:42  Rocky Bernstein

	* example/cdchange.c: cdchange doesn't use off_t, ssize or any
	  fancy types so it shouldn't #include SYS_TYPES. Furthermore if
	  cdio needs it, it should #include it on its own.

2007-04-15 Sunday 16:39  Rocky Bernstein

	  #18563

2006-12-14 Thursday 00:45  Rocky Bernstein

2006-03-07 Tuesday 20:54  Rocky Bernstein

	* include/cdio++/iso9660.hpp, lib/cdio++/iso9660.cpp: Go back to
	  inlining various functions because older STL's can't handle not
	  having the bodies. (I think this is what's going on, but I'm not
	  completely sure. Deals with failure on older BSDI and gcc 2.95

2006-03-07 Tuesday 11:19  Rocky Bernstein

	* lib/: cdda_interface/Makefile.am, driver/Makefile.am,
	  iso9660/Makefile.am, paranoia/Makefile.am: Don't do library

2006-01-23 Monday 20:47  Rocky Bernstein

2006-01-23 Monday 04:07  Rocky Bernstein

	  to ensure derived scripts in test are made executable.

2006-01-22 Sunday 08:17  Rocky Bernstein

	* example/tracks.c: We were assuming first_track is 1. It isn't

2006-01-21 Saturday 12:02  Rocky Bernstein

	* NEWS, configure.ac, include/cdio/device.h, include/cdio/read.h,

	* test/testbincue.c: Add test of set blocksize and set speed.

2006-01-21 Saturday 11:04  Rocky Bernstein

	* example/C++/OO/eject.cpp, include/cdio++/cdio.hpp,
	  include/cdio++/device.hpp: Went the subclassed exception route
	  (at the expense of lots of extra code and possibly extra
	  maintenance). It will match the Python interface and it's I guess
	  what Stroustrup recommends.

2006-01-15 Sunday 10:39  Rocky Bernstein

	* example/C++/OO/eject.cpp, include/cdio++/cdio.hpp,
	  include/cdio++/device.hpp: Convert routines in device.hpp into

	  location.

2006-01-05 Thursday 22:01  Rocky Bernstein

	* lib/cdio++/stub.cpp: In C++ read.h needs <sys/types.h>. Don't
	  know if this should be fixed here (where we could concievably
	  check for HAVE_SYS_TYPES_H or in read.h (where it would be inde
	  via cdio_config.h, but for now we'll do it this way.

2006-01-05 Thursday 21:58  Rocky Bernstein

	* lib/paranoia/p_block.c: Using inline seems to cause a linking

2006-01-05 Thursday 21:57  Rocky Bernstein

	* configure.ac, largefile.m4: Add largefile support. For example
	  ISO images over 2G.  Problem and suggestion of where to look for

2005-12-22 Thursday 17:25  Rocky Bernstein

	  inside CdioDevice class.  Some comments/code in sample programs
	  gone over and new onse added for libcdio++.

2005-11-12 Saturday 10:27  Rocky Bernstein

	* example/Makefile.am: Typo causing compilation failure on OSX.
	  Thanks to Steve Schultz.

2005-11-11 Friday 12:47  Rocky Bernstein

	* src/cd-read.c: Use new read_sector routine.

2005-11-11 Friday 12:26  Rocky Bernstein

	  Add pre- and post- increment/decrement operators for libcdio
	  enums that it makes sense to iterate over.

	  example/C++/OO/*: use these example/*: match up C and C++
	  programs better.

2005-11-10 Thursday 11:22  Rocky Bernstein

	  include/cdio++/track.hpp, lib/cdio++/.cvsignore,
	  lib/cdio++/Makefile.am, lib/cdio++/stub.cpp: First cut at a C++
	  wrapper for libcdio libcdio++. What's not done are audio and MMC
	  commands. No doubt it may be a little rough and I expect further
	  changes.

2005-11-10 Thursday 11:08  Rocky Bernstein

	* example/Makefile.am: Note more LIBCDIO dependencies for more
	  programs. Pity automake doesn't handle this more automatically.

2005-11-10 Thursday 11:02  Rocky Bernstein

	* example/Makefile.am: Add eject example program and the
	  LIBCDIO_DEPS dependencies.

	  cdtext.h: Small typo.

2005-11-08 Tuesday 23:21  pjcreath

	* lib/paranoia/: gap.c, paranoia.c: Documented silence matching

2005-11-07 Monday 20:06  pjcreath

	* lib/paranoia/: gap.c, overlap.c, paranoia.c: Commented stage 2
	  extensively.

2005-11-07 Monday 19:48  pjcreath

	* lib/: cdda_interface/cddap_interface.c, paranoia/paranoia.c:
	  Cleaned up TRACE_PARANOIA and added some messages for the skip
	  case.

2005-11-07 Monday 07:54  Rocky Bernstein

	* example/: C++/.cvsignore, .cvsignore: Add eject

2005-11-07 Monday 07:54  Rocky Bernstein

	* lib/driver/libcdio.sym: Add cdio_eject_media_drive.

2005-11-07 Monday 07:53  Rocky Bernstein

	  Makefile.am: Add some of the dependency tracking.

2005-11-07 Monday 07:49  Rocky Bernstein

	  trouble keeping track of all them.

2005-11-07 Monday 07:45  Rocky Bernstein

	  example/isofuzzy.c, example/C++/iso2.cpp, include/cdio/cdio.h,
	  include/cdio/device.h, lib/driver/device.c: Add interface to
	  eject CD-ROM by device name.	eject.c: new routine to test/show
	  this.  example/*.c iso2.cpp: Note in comment allowance of an
	  optional argument.

2005-11-07 Monday 07:41  Rocky Bernstein

	* lib/driver/gnu_linux.c: Was giving a failure status on eject when
	  it succeeded. The failure was because ioctl(fd, BLKRRPART) didn't
	  succeed. Turn this into a cdio_info warning instead.

2005-11-06 Sunday 22:50  Rocky Bernstein

	* include/cdio/device.h: Small typos.

2005-11-06 Sunday 20:02  Rocky Bernstein

	* include/cdio/rock.h, lib/iso9660/rock.c: More separation between
	  posix_mode_t and mode_t.

2005-11-06 Sunday 19:26  Rocky Bernstein

	* include/cdio/udf.h: posix_mode_t -> mode_t

2005-11-06 Sunday 19:15  Rocky Bernstein

	* include/cdio/iso9660.h, lib/iso9660/iso9660.c: Return type of
	  iso9660_get_posix_mode should be mode_t (the OS-specific
	  version), not posix_mode_t (cdio's internally consistent version.

2005-11-06 Sunday 19:12  Rocky Bernstein

	* include/cdio/udf_file.h: I think mode_t (not posix_mode_t) is
	  correct here. The goal is to use in normal OS file operations.

2005-11-06 Sunday 00:42  Rocky Bernstein

	* lib/udf/filemode.c: Need #include<sys/stat.h>

2005-11-06 Sunday 00:39  Rocky Bernstein

	  definitions to posix.h Add ISO9660 routines to convert to mode_t
	  Record whether XA or not in iso9660_stat_t.  And other definition
	  shifting around.

2005-11-04 Friday 09:38  Rocky Bernstein

	* src/cd-paranoia/Makefile.am: Patch from Steve Schultz

	  yet.)

2005-11-02 Wednesday 03:49  Rocky Bernstein

	* include/cdio/udf_file.h, lib/udf/udf_file.c: A couple of
	  corrections on udf_get_file_length().

2005-11-02 Wednesday 03:42  Rocky Bernstein

	* example/udf1.c, include/cdio/udf_file.h, lib/udf/libudf.sym,
	  lib/udf/udf_file.c, lib/udf/udf_fs.c: Add routine to get file
	  length.  Fix bug in retrieving dirent for root.  Reduce overhead
	  in udf_get_link_count()

2005-11-01 Tuesday 13:07  Rocky Bernstein

	* example/Makefile.am, example/udf1.c, include/cdio/udf.h,
	  lib/udf/udf_file.c, lib/udf/udf_fs.c: udf_find_file -> udf_fopen
	  and made closer to fopen(). It also simplifies things a little
	  bit. Start testing.

2005-11-01 Tuesday 03:21  Rocky Bernstein

	* example/udf1.c, include/cdio/udf_file.h, lib/udf/udf_fs.c: Remove
	  extraneous parameter on udf_opendir().

2005-11-01 Tuesday 03:14  Rocky Bernstein

	  lib/udf/udf_time.c: Rename some functions to be more like POSIX
	  file reading, i.e. add udf_opendir() and udf_readdir().
	  udf_file_entry_t -> udf_dirent_t.

2005-10-30 Sunday 16:09  Rocky Bernstein

	* src/iso-info.c: Remove small valgrind memory leak.

2005-10-30 Sunday 16:04  Rocky Bernstein

	* example/udf1.c: Fix small valgrind leak.

2005-10-30 Sunday 15:58  Rocky Bernstein

	* example/udf1.c, src/iso-info.c: udf1.c: Do better about dealing
	  with recursive directories.  iso-info.c: small variable name
	  change

2005-10-30 Sunday 14:26  Rocky Bernstein

	* example/iso2.c: Minor misspelling in comment.

2005-10-30 Sunday 14:25  Rocky Bernstein

	* example/C++/iso2.cpp: Minor typographical misspellings in comment

2005-10-30 Sunday 14:10  Rocky Bernstein

	* include/cdio/udf_time.h, lib/udf/udf_time.c: udf_times_to_stamp
	  -> udf_timespec_to_stamp

2005-10-30 Sunday 07:36  Rocky Bernstein

	* include/cdio/udf_file.h: Break off udf_file routines from udf.h

2005-10-30 Sunday 07:35  Rocky Bernstein

	* example/udf1.c, include/cdio/Makefile.am, include/cdio/udf.h,

2005-10-30 Sunday 06:06  Rocky Bernstein

	* lib/udf/udf_time.c: Replace some numbers with enum "constants".

2005-10-30 Sunday 05:43  Rocky Bernstein

	* example/udf1.c, include/cdio/ecma_167.h, include/cdio/udf.h,
	  lib/udf/Makefile.am, lib/udf/filemode.c, lib/udf/libudf.sym,
	  lib/udf/udf.c: Fill out file modes better and clean up interface
	  more by trying to funnel into POSIX file mode_t. FIXME: something
	  needs to be done to merge ISO9660 interfaces and UDF and probably
	  the right thing is to make it look like POSIX. Would be nice if
	  there were a library e.g. from GNU fileutils I could use to help.

2005-10-29 Saturday 14:52  Rocky Bernstein

	* example/udf1.c, lib/udf/udf.c: Fill out posix attributes a
	  little. Add directory listing to output.

2005-10-29 Saturday 14:43  Rocky Bernstein

	  access functions.

2005-10-29 Saturday 03:43  Rocky Bernstein

	* include/cdio/ecma_167.h: OS/X's linker does not permit common
	  symbols in shared libs.

2005-10-28 Friday 12:43  Rocky Bernstein

	* lib/driver/MSWindows/win32.c: Use MMC routine for reading data
	  blocks. At leat on XP home it seems to work better than generic
	  read which is a cooked read.

2005-10-27 Thursday 11:20  Rocky Bernstein

	* parse/toc.L: Lex/Flex cdrdao TOC scanner

2005-10-27 Thursday 11:18  Rocky Bernstein

	* include/cdio/ecma_167.h, include/cdio/udf.h,
	  include/cdio/udf_time.h, lib/udf/libudf.sym, lib/udf/udf.c,
	  lib/udf/udf_fs.c, lib/udf/udf_time.c: More documentation of ecma

2005-10-27 Thursday 03:03  Rocky Bernstein

	* configure.ac, lib/udf/udf_private.h, lib/udf/udf_time.c: Changes
	  to make work on Cygwin. However probably need a more general test
	  for timezone being extern long.

2005-10-27 Thursday 01:23  Rocky Bernstein

	* example/udf1.c, include/cdio/udf.h, lib/udf/libudf.sym,
	  lib/udf/udf.c, lib/udf/udf_fs.c: File entry update fixed on
	  udf_get_next().  More access functions added to return a UDF file
	  entry and to interpret a permission string.

2005-10-26 Wednesday 23:55  Rocky Bernstein

	* include/cdio/track.h: Typo.

2005-10-26 Wednesday 02:05  Rocky Bernstein

	* example/udf1.c, include/cdio/Makefile.am, include/cdio/udf.h,
	  include/cdio/udf_time.h, lib/udf/Makefile.am, lib/udf/libudf.sym,
	  lib/udf/udf_fs.c, lib/udf/udf_private.h, lib/udf/udf_time.c: Add
	  some UDF time routines and time-conversion routines.	Note:
	  udf_get_next() needs to advance file entry info

2005-10-25 Tuesday 14:16  pjcreath

	* configure.ac, example/Makefile.am, src/cd-paranoia/Makefile.am:
	  Fixed Darwin builds broken by dependency tracking.

2005-10-25 Tuesday 13:20  Rocky Bernstein

	* example/udf1.c: libiso9660 -> libudf

2005-10-25 Tuesday 13:19  Rocky Bernstein

	* example/udf1.c, include/cdio/udf.h, lib/udf/udf_fs.c: Add routine
	  to get volumeset id

2005-10-25 Tuesday 12:58  Rocky Bernstein

	* README.libcdio: Much needed revision.

2005-10-25 Tuesday 12:35  Rocky Bernstein

	* README: We *are* now adding UDF support.

2005-10-25 Tuesday 03:13  Rocky Bernstein

	* example/udf1.c, include/cdio/ecma_167.h, include/cdio/udf.h,
	  lib/udf/libudf.sym, lib/udf/udf_fs.c: Add silly volume
	  identifier. More #defines removed in favor of enums.

2005-10-25 Tuesday 01:19  Rocky Bernstein

	* example/udf1.c, lib/udf/udf_fs.c: Remove memory leak and invalid
	  write references thanks to valgrind.	Now lists all files
	  correctly - at least in the absense of directories under /.

2005-10-24 Monday 19:42  pjcreath

	* lib/paranoia/p_block.c, lib/paranoia/paranoia.c,
	  src/cd-paranoia/cd-paranoia.c: Added TRACE_PARANOIA, which
	  differs from cdparanoia's NOISY compile-time flag in that it's
	  designed to help someone understand how cdparanoia works, rather
	  than troubleshoot.  Setting TRACE_PARANOIA to 1 traces stage 1, 2
	  trace stage 2, and 3 traces both (and is extremely verbose).

	  Additionally, committed a tentative bugfix to paranoia itself,
	  which was causing the libcdio test case to break.  If it
	  introduces unexpected behavior, it should be backed out.  So far
	  it seems to fix all test cases.

2005-10-24 Monday 10:14  Rocky Bernstein

	* example/udf1.c, include/cdio/udf.h, lib/udf/Makefile.am,
	  lib/udf/libudf.sym, lib/udf/udf.c, lib/udf/udf_fs.c,
	  lib/udf/udf_private.h: UDF file is now opaque. Access routines
	  then added.  Note: there are valgrind and free() errors that need
	  going over.

2005-10-24 Monday 08:51  Rocky Bernstein

	* lib/udf/libudf.sym: List more of the external routines
	  (udf_get_next, udf_get_sub)

2005-10-24 Monday 03:23  Rocky Bernstein

	* lib/udf/.cvsignore: Ignore the usual.

2005-10-24 Monday 03:22  Rocky Bernstein

2005-10-24 Monday 03:14  Rocky Bernstein

	* lib/udf/Makefile.am: Makefile.am for libudf

2005-10-24 Monday 03:12  Rocky Bernstein

	* src/cd-paranoia/cd-paranoia.c: MinGW tolerance. Patches based on
	  those by Eric Lunchpail

2005-10-24 Monday 02:57  Rocky Bernstein

	* src/cd-info.c: Follow 0.76 (and below) behaviour: we don't
	  require a device to explicitly be given.

2005-10-23 Sunday 12:56  Rocky Bernstein

	* configure.ac: Add tests for gettimeofday(), {sete,get}{u,g}id()
	  More of the UDF library code mechanism put in.

2005-10-23 Sunday 12:17  Rocky Bernstein

	* lib/paranoia/paranoia.c: Remove a #define we don't need.

2005-10-23 Sunday 11:32  Rocky Bernstein

	* lib/cdda_interface/low_interface.h: Rmove references to external
	  (SCSI) routines that don't in fact exist.

2005-10-23 Sunday 11:28  Rocky Bernstein

	* lib/cdda_interface/cddap_interface.c: Patch by Erik Lunchpail to
	  accomodate systems (e.g. MinGW) that don't have drand48 but have
	  rand.

2005-10-21 Friday 12:34  Rocky Bernstein

	* lib/udf/libudf.sym: Start list of external symbols for Nicholas.

2005-10-21 Friday 12:33  Rocky Bernstein

	* include/cdio/: ecma_167.h, udf.h: udf.h: Mostly add a couple more
	  routines and more fields in udf_file_t ecma_167.h: more udf_
	  prefixes, add extern debugger symbols.

2005-10-21 Friday 12:31  Rocky Bernstein

	* lib/udf/udf_fs.c: Start some UDF routines. Very preliminary.

2005-10-21 Friday 11:51  Rocky Bernstein

2005-10-21 Friday 11:27  Rocky Bernstein

	* include/cdio/mmc.h, lib/driver/libcdio.sym, lib/driver/mmc.c:
	  Turn one more set of #define into an enum

2005-10-21 Friday 11:13  Rocky Bernstein

	* include/cdio/mmc.h, lib/driver/gnu_linux.c,
	  lib/driver/libcdio.sym, lib/driver/mmc.c,
	  lib/driver/mmc_private.h: Try to regularize naming better. More
	  mmc_ -> cdio_mmc_ Add more debug variables to be able to get at
	  enum values in a debugger.

2005-10-20 Thursday 00:26  Rocky Bernstein

	* autogen.sh: Add --include-deps based on a suggestion by Burkhard
	  Plaum.

2005-10-19 Wednesday 07:06  Rocky Bernstein

	* include/cdio/udf.h: Redo UDF_BLOCKSIZE so we can use symbol in
	  debugging.

2005-10-19 Wednesday 06:55  Rocky Bernstein

	* include/cdio/: ecma_167.h, udf.h: More changes based on use.

2005-10-19 Wednesday 05:45  Rocky Bernstein

	* include/cdio/ecma_167.h: Add udf_fileid_desc_t: were getting
	  closer to being able to deal with files now.

	  Add remaining udf_ prefixes extent_ad_{s,t} and lb_addr_{s,t}

2005-10-19 Wednesday 05:41  Rocky Bernstein

	* include/cdio/udf.h: Add udf_close().	udf_seek_read() renamed to
	  udf_read_sectors().  First (lame) attempt to define UDF file
	  entry structure.

2005-10-18 Tuesday 03:14  Rocky Bernstein

	* include/cdio/ecma_167.h: Typo.

2005-10-18 Tuesday 03:12  Rocky Bernstein

	* include/cdio/ecma_167.h: Add udf_ to another type (udf_icbtag)

2005-10-18 Tuesday 03:10  Rocky Bernstein

	* include/cdio/ecma_167.h: More changes based on use.

2005-10-18 Tuesday 01:21  Rocky Bernstein

	* src/cd-paranoia/Makefile.am: Not sure if this commit is correct
	  and/or why it should be needed (if it is correct).

	  We note a dependencies between cd-paranoia and its libraries.
	  Section 7.4 "Program and Library Variables" of the automake 1.9.5
	  manual says:

	       If `_DEPENDENCIES' is not supplied, it is computed by
	  Automake.
	       The automatically-assigned value is the contents of `_LDADD'
	  or
	       `_LIBADD', with most configure substitutions, `-l', `-L',
	       `-dlopen' and `-dlpreopen' options removed.  The configure
	       substitutions that are left in are only `$(LIBOBJS)' and
	       `$(ALLOCA)'; these are left because it is known that they
	  will not
	       cause an invalid value for `_DEPENDENCIES' to be generated.

2005-10-17 Monday 23:50  Rocky Bernstein

	* lib/iso9660/libiso9660.sym: Allow folks to refer to and use
	  ISO_STANDARD_ID

2005-10-17 Monday 20:56  pjcreath

	* lib/paranoia/isort.h: Added comments to the sort_info_t macros,
	  including the scary pointer arithmetic that makes ipos() tick.

2005-10-17 Monday 15:31  pjcreath

	* lib/paranoia/paranoia.c: Extensively commented cdparanoia's stage
	  1 matching.  No code changes apart from added white space for
	  improved readability.  Comments containing "???" suggest areas
	  for further study and documentation.

2005-10-17 Monday 15:10  pjcreath

	* test/check_paranoia.sh.in: Changed the underrun+jitter test to
	  use small jitter, since medium jitter is now broken.	The test

	  As of now it's okay to just #include <cdio/paranoia.h> or include

	* lib/driver/FreeBSD/freebsd_ioctl.c: Patch from Diego 'Flameeyes'
	  Pettenò to eject_media_freebsd_ioctl():

	  Allegedly this works better than the CAM mode eject; CAM gets the
	  error "Device not ready" when trying to eject an empty CD-ROM
	  drive.

	  We make use of an already open file descriptor to the CD-ROM
	  instead of opening a new one (else we have two file descriptor
	  open, so when it launch the ioctl() to eject the device it
	  results busy because of the other fd).

	  Also corrects the documentation comment about the return value.

	  ND-3520A, 1.04, SCSI CD-ROM) was getting set as big endian
	  although it appeared not to, possibly because of SCSI emulation.

	  We now test for SCSIness in addition to ATAPIness as both can
	  occur.

	  Added field in cdrom_device structure for SCSIness and that's
	  tested before unconditionally setting drive bigendian-ness.

2005-04-27 Wednesday 23:31  Rocky Bernstein

	* doc/glossary.texi, include/cdio/util.h: glossary.texi: CDTEXT ->
	  CD Text util.h: allow getting larger sector count sizes. CD's new
	  900MB could exceed 16-bits.

2005-04-25 Monday 23:06  Rocky Bernstein

	* include/cdio/cdtext.h, lib/driver/cdtext.c,
	  lib/driver/libcdio.sym: From Burkhard Plaum:

	  1. Fix a crash, which happened when cdtext_get() was called for
	  an emtp= y	(i.e. NULL) field.

	  2. Add another function cdtext_get_const(), which returns a const
	  point= er    and avoids too much strcpying (apps may want only to
	  TEST if a    field is present or have their own string management
	  routines).

2005-04-23 Saturday 01:16  Rocky Bernstein

	* lib/driver/: _cdio_generic.c, generic.h, gnu_linux.c, osx.c,
	  solaris.c: Patch from Burkhard Plaum:

	  1. In the function is_cdrom_linux(...) in the file
	  lib/driver/gnu_linux.c,    the CDROMREADTOCHDR ioctl gets called,
	  which fails when the drive is    empty. The CDROM_GET_CAPABILITY
	  ioctl always succeeds for CDrom drives    and fails for hard
	  disks etc.

	  2. For some reason, at least my (GNU/Linux 2.6.10) Kernel fails
	  to	open empty drives, when only O_RDONLY is used. Changing the
	  open flag to	  O_RDONLY|O_NONBLOCK, the call succeeds also for
	  emtpy drives.     By the way, the cdrom header file in the kernel
	  says explicitely,	that O_RDONLY|O_NONBLOCK should used
	  whenever a cdrom is touched.

	  rocky: also made a change to eject to continue even if we can't
	  get the drive status -- which we can't with an empty CD-ROM
	  drive.

	* lib/driver/: cdtext.c, cdtext_private.h, mmc.c: loop over cdtext
	  using length reported back by MMC TOC command.  Test sequence
	  number only for valid blocks.  cdtext_private.h: add enumeration

2005-03-18 Friday 01:15  Rocky Bernstein

	* include/cdio/types.h: Apparently some are depending on
	  sizeof(bool) to be 1 byte. I don't see this in libcdio, but I

2005-02-18 Friday 09:49  Rocky Bernstein

	* lib/driver/mmc.c: Mode sense changes. Not sure about this though.

2005-02-18 Friday 01:31  Rocky Bernstein

	* lib/iso9660/iso9660_fs.c, lib/iso9660/rock.c, src/cd-info.c:
	  iso9660_fs.c: reallocate filename when Rock-Ridge name is bigger.

	  rock.c: variable name changes

	  Extensions.

	  Remove more of the no longer needed distinction (that we
	  sometimes got wrong) of Mode 1 vs Mode 2 data reading.

2005-02-17 Thursday 07:03  Rocky Bernstein

	* include/cdio/mmc.h, include/cdio/read.h,

2005-02-17 Thursday 04:29  Rocky Bernstein

	* include/cdio/iso9660.h: Add type definitions for achar, dchar and
	  ISO 9660 7.1.1 - ISO 7.3.3 types and use them. This frees up
	  space for better comments about he feild names of a PVD or SVD.

2005-02-12 Saturday 15:27  Rocky Bernstein

	* include/cdio/: device.h, mmc.h: Remove doxygen references to

	* doc/libcdio.texi: Document _e, _s, and _t suffixes

2005-02-12 Saturday 09:52  Rocky Bernstein

	* include/cdio/xa.h: signature is probably better typed as a char

2005-02-09 Wednesday 09:55  Rocky Bernstein

	  whatever.

	  cdda_interface: Use mmc_have_inteface() we don't have anything
	  for this except in GNU/Linux. May reduce the unnecessary
	  data_bigendianp() calls which cause lots of disc reading.

	  Turn #defines for MMC Profiles into enumeration.  Add enumeration
	  for "core" interface types

	  #include <cdio/scsi_mmc.h> -> #include <cdio/mmc.h>

2005-02-06 Sunday 17:36  Rocky Bernstein

	* lib/cdda_interface/: Makefile.am, cddap_interface.c,
	  cooked_interface.c, interface.c, low_interface.h: cooked ->

2005-02-03 Thursday 07:36  Rocky Bernstein

2005-02-03 Thursday 07:28  Rocky Bernstein

2005-02-03 Thursday 07:19  Rocky Bernstein

	* doc/: .cvsignore, version.texi: Even though this file is
	  automatically generated, CVS for the automake project seems to

2005-01-30 Sunday 06:37  Rocky Bernstein

	* libcdio_paranoia.pc.in: Picking up wrong library: need
	  libcdio_cdda, not cdda_interface

2005-01-30 Sunday 03:18  Rocky Bernstein

	* libcdio_cdda.pc.in, libcdio_paranoia.pc.in, libiso9660.pc.in:
	  libcdio_*: names probably need to be something other that libcdio
	  which is already in use.  libsio9660: minor title change

2005-01-29 Saturday 21:20  Rocky Bernstein

	* lib/driver/libcdio.sym: Missing cdio_error.

	  remove AIX driver for now - it doesn't really work remove some
	  (but not all) of the valgrind errors in cd-text Some stylistic
	  things, doxygen comment improvements typos, etc.

2005-01-26 Wednesday 01:21  Rocky Bernstein

	* include/cdio/: cdda.h, paranoia.h: Add an easy way to turn off
	  paranoia compatibility.

	* example/paranoia2.c, include/cdio/cdda.h,
	  lib/cdda_interface/interface.c, lib/driver/_cdio_generic.c,
	  lib/driver/device.c: Add a cdda_close that doesn't free the
	  p_cdio pointer for those cases where an application may want to
	  keep that pointer open.

	  All routines now are distinct from parnaoia routines with
	  suitable #defines for compatibility.

	  lib/cdda_interface/cooked_interface.c,
	  lib/cdda_interface/interface.c,
	  lib/cdda_interface/scan_devices.c, test/testparanoia.c:
	  libcdio_cdda.pc.in: had wrong cdda_interface library

	  Rename paranoia routines to cdio-specific names so both libraries
	  can coexist.	And I think it makes debugging a little easier if
	  not clearer.

2005-01-25 Tuesday 03:56  Rocky Bernstein

	* .cvsignore, libcdio.pc.in, libcdio_cdda.pc.in,

	  returns lsn_t and CDIO_INVALID_LSN on error.

	  Add MMC version of get_disc_last_lsn.

	  More regularization of driver_return_code_t and get_disc_last_lsn

	  There's probably some small driver breakage which will be fixed
	  soon.

2005-01-23 Sunday 19:16  Rocky Bernstein

	  routines so the use the driver_return_code_t enumeration.  It's a
	  little cleaner and may make things clearer in debugging.

2005-01-23 Sunday 17:14  Rocky Bernstein

	* lib/driver/MSWindows/win32.c: Use SCSI-MMC routine for reading
	  audio sectors. ioctl READRAW doesn't always word and is slow.

2005-01-23 Sunday 14:05  Rocky Bernstein

	* lib/: cdda_interface/interface.c, paranoia/paranoia.c: Work
	  around problem where we were accessing outside of an allocate
	  range when the drive endian was different than the CD-ROM
	  endianness. We do this by always allocating an extra block, but
	  it would be better to understand whether this is correct or
	  whether some logic needs to be fixed.

2005-01-23 Sunday 05:54  Rocky Bernstein

	* test/testparanoia.c: Remove access of uninitialized memory.

2005-01-23 Sunday 05:51  Rocky Bernstein

	* lib/driver/_cdio_sunos.c: Valgrind-caught memory leak.

2005-01-23 Sunday 00:45  Rocky Bernstein

	* test/: Makefile.am, bad-file.toc, data5.toc, data6.toc,
	  data7.toc, testtoc.c: Since we have better TOC checking we now
	  have to give real filenames.	Adjust for this. Also added a
	  regression test with a bad file name.

2005-01-23 Sunday 00:27  Rocky Bernstein

	* lib/cdda_interface/: common_interface.c, utils.h: Nope. Didn't
	  get it right this time either with the byteswapping.	However
	  we've at least reduced the customness.

2005-01-23 Sunday 00:20  Rocky Bernstein

	* lib/cdda_interface/: common_interface.c, utils.h: Use common
	  byte-swapping routines and remove cdparanoia-specific ones.
	  (This time, for sure!)

2005-01-22 Saturday 23:57  Rocky Bernstein

	* lib/driver/image.h, lib/driver/image/cdrdao.c, test/Makefile.am,
	  test/check_cue.sh.in, test/vcd_demo.toc, test/vcd_demo_toc.right:
	  Improve cdrdao to handle MSF-length.

	  Remove vcd_demo_toc.right since the cd-info output is now the
	  same as vcd_demo.right vcd_demo.toc adjusted accordingly.

2005-01-22 Saturday 22:21  Rocky Bernstein

	* src/: cd-drive.c, cd-info.c, iso-info.c, iso-read.c: Version

2005-01-22 Saturday 19:39  Rocky Bernstein

	* include/cdio/version.h.in, src/cd-paranoia/version.h,
	  test/check_paranoia.sh.in: check_paranoia.sh.in: Add a more
	  agressive paranoia test.

	  *version.h*: Include build name in version listings.

2005-01-22 Saturday 18:54  Rocky Bernstein

	* test/check_paranoia.sh.in: Was missing move of jitter output.

2005-01-22 Saturday 18:49  Rocky Bernstein

	* example/README: More about where to look for examples.

2005-01-22 Saturday 18:43  Rocky Bernstein

2005-01-22 Saturday 12:51  Rocky Bernstein

	* lib/driver/FreeBSD/freebsd.c: Add a CAM read audio now that
	  CDIOREADAUDIO deosn't work on newer FreeBSDs.  Deal with recent
	  generic->mmc name changes.

2005-01-22 Saturday 11:22  Rocky Bernstein

	* lib/driver/_cdio_stream.c: Don't attempt to see before the
	  beginning of a file.

2005-01-22 Saturday 03:45  Rocky Bernstein

	* lib/cdda_interface/: common_interface.c, common_interface.h,
	  scan_devices.c: Add routines which allow cdio object to be opened
	  before cdda_open.  common_interface.h: data_bigendianp() is now
	  public (in cdio/cdda.h)

2005-01-22 Saturday 03:43  Rocky Bernstein

	* include/cdio/cdda.h: Add interfaces which allow opening a cdio
	  object before running paranoia.  data_bigendianp is too neat to
	  keep it private.

2005-01-22 Saturday 03:41  Rocky Bernstein

	* example/: Makefile.am, paranoia.c, paranoia2.c: Add an example
	  which opens the cdio object first. Also show off
	  data_bigendianp().

2005-01-22 Saturday 01:18  Rocky Bernstein

	* cvs2cl_usermap: Add Justin's info.

2005-01-21 Friday 23:12  Rocky Bernstein

	  Remove a number of const's since Darwin's run_scsi_mmc doesn't
	  work that way :-(

2005-01-21 Friday 15:30  Rocky Bernstein

	* lib/driver/MSWindows/win32.c: routine name change.

2005-01-21 Friday 10:11  Rocky Bernstein

	* NEWS, lib/driver/_cdio_stream.c, lib/driver/image.h,
	  lib/driver/image/cdrdao.c, test/vcd_demo_toc.right:
	  _cdio_stream.c: replace assert's with failures.  Make cdrdao be
	  able to handle the kind of images vcdimager produces.

	  There was a slight regression (perhaps so vcd_demo_toc.right may
	  in fact not be right. Deal with some other time.

2005-01-21 Friday 03:15  Rocky Bernstein

	* lib/driver/_cdio_osx.c: Remove get_scsi for now.

	  scsi_mmc.c, scsi_mmc_private.h, FreeBSD/freebsd.c,
	  MSWindows/win32.c: Move some of the "generic" routines using MMC
	  into SCSI-MMC. Think is a little bit clearer and cleaner.

2005-01-21 Friday 02:57  Rocky Bernstein

	* lib/driver/read.c: Remove probably some serious lapses: Now check
	  all reads for exceeding end of disc and info messages can be
	  logged. We were also returning 0 on error reads. Regularize by
	  using a couple of macros.

2005-01-20 Thursday 14:58  Rocky Bernstein

	* lib/driver/FreeBSD/freebsd.c: Missed a couple of env -> p_env's

2005-01-20 Thursday 12:36  Rocky Bernstein

	* lib/driver/_cdio_osx.c: Add Scott Wood's code for issuing
	  SCSI-MMC command. It doesn't work though.

2005-01-20 Thursday 05:07  Rocky Bernstein

	* lib/driver/: _cdio_generic.c, _cdio_linux.c, _cdio_sunos.c,
	  cdio_private.h, generic.h, FreeBSD/freebsd.c,
	  FreeBSD/freebsd_cam.c: Add get_blocksize. There may be some
	  breakage as I haven't tested all of the various drivers yet.

2005-01-20 Thursday 04:51  Rocky Bernstein

	  generic.

	  Add _t to yet another type.

2005-01-19 Wednesday 17:25  Rocky Bernstein

	  this more robust. 'Dunno.

2005-01-19 Wednesday 17:24  Rocky Bernstein

	* lib/cdda_interface/scan_devices.c: Even though this may not be
	  nstrictly the way the original cdda_interface does things, add a
	  spaces between the vendor, model, and revison number.

2005-01-19 Wednesday 17:23  Rocky Bernstein

	* src/cd-paranoia/cd-paranoia.c: Accomodate Windows that sometimes
	  gives an argc that seems one greater than what's not NULL in
	  argv. And it is probably a good idea anyway to test for null
	  strings before calling strdup()

2005-01-19 Wednesday 09:42  Rocky Bernstein

	* lib/driver/_cdio_bsdi.c: Change to use driver_return_t

2005-01-19 Wednesday 09:40  Rocky Bernstein

	  lib/driver/image_common.c, lib/driver/scsi_mmc.c: Try to
	  regularize driver operation return codes via a new enumeation
	  return type. (I may regret this later as we return ioctl's int
	  value in some cases).

	  cdio.h: get/set_arg moved to device.

2005-01-18 Tuesday 16:05  Rocky Bernstein

	* lib/cdda_interface/interface.c: Do not try to process if we got
	  errors. More needs to be done, but this is a start.

2005-01-18 Tuesday 12:59  Rocky Bernstein

	* src/cd-paranoia/doc/cd-paranoia.1.in: Note change in -g option

	  command.

	  Some more variable convention regularizations.

2005-01-17 Monday 17:20  Rocky Bernstein

	* lib/driver/: _cdio_aix.c, _cdio_bsdi.c, _cdio_linux.c,

	  image/cdrdao.c, image/nrg.c: add _t to another time. driver_id
	  inside p_cdio wasn't initialized.

2005-01-17 Monday 16:29  Rocky Bernstein

	* example/paranoia.c: We don't need driver_id, so simplify this
	  code a little bit.

2005-01-16 Sunday 13:08  Rocky Bernstein

	* configure.ac, src/cd-paranoia/Makefile.am,
	  src/cd-paranoia/cd-paranoia.c, src/cd-paranoia/usage.txt.in,

	  documentation into its own directory.

2005-01-16 Sunday 04:35  Rocky Bernstein

	* test/testtoc.c: Add another VCD toc test. We can't actually
	  handle this fully, but at least we can parse it correctly (I
	  think).

2005-01-16 Sunday 04:34  Rocky Bernstein

	* test/vcd2.toc: Add another TOC test. This one taken from one
	  modified from Steve Schultz's VCD collection.

2005-01-16 Sunday 04:28  Rocky Bernstein

	* lib/driver/image/cdrdao.c: At least parse DATAFILE lines more
	  fully. Things are better but we're still having problems reading
	  the ISO-9660 of sms VCD's.

2005-01-16 Sunday 04:25  Rocky Bernstein

	* lib/driver/image.h: It appears for cdrdao datastart needs to be
	  larger. Could possibly be unsigned too.

2005-01-16 Sunday 04:23  Rocky Bernstein

	* include/cdio/cdda.h: Redo bit masks for test flags. Should
	  accomodate what is in (even if not working) in cdparanoia.

2005-01-16 Sunday 04:20  Rocky Bernstein

	* test/: .cvsignore, Makefile.am: Remove testparanoia .raw output
	  on clean Also ignore these for CVS if they are around.

2005-01-15 Saturday 16:08  Rocky Bernstein

	* include/cdio/cdda.h, src/cd-paranoia/cd-paranoia.c: Remove a

	  lib/cdda_interface/interface.c,
	  lib/cdda_interface/scan_devices.c, src/cd-paranoia/cd-paranoia.c,
	  test/check_paranoia.sh.in: Add regression-test mechanism. Right
	  now we only have underrun testing.  Perhaps more later...
	  cd-paranoia: -x option added to specify what to test.

2005-01-15 Saturday 10:19  Rocky Bernstein

	* src/cd-paranoia/cd-paranoia.c: Replace some paranoia-specific
	  copystring's with strdups.

2005-01-15 Saturday 10:17  Rocky Bernstein

	* test/: Makefile.am, check_paranoia.sh.in: Start another
	  cd-paranoia test. This one uses image reading so it doesn't
	  require a CD-DA loaded.

2005-01-15 Saturday 03:22  Rocky Bernstein

	* lib/cdda_interface/scan_devices.c: Redo in a way simpler way that
	  and in a way that valgrind doesn't think there's a memory leak.

2005-01-15 Saturday 02:23  Rocky Bernstein

	* lib/cdda_interface/cooked_interface.c,
	  src/cd-paranoia/cd-paranoia.c: cooked_interface.c: check for
	  TOC-read error.  cd-paranoia.c: check that list of drives isn't
	  just NULL list.

2005-01-14 Friday 22:04  Rocky Bernstein

	* lib/driver/_cdio_osx.c: Small error. Used the wrong variable for
	  extracting the revision.

2005-01-14 Friday 21:41  Rocky Bernstein

	* lib/driver/MSWindows/win32.c: More changes to deal with error
	  conditions.

2005-01-14 Friday 21:40  Rocky Bernstein

	* test/Makefile.am: Need to put in libcdio libs for testparanoia.

2005-01-14 Friday 19:25  Rocky Bernstein

	* lib/driver/device.c, lib/driver/MSWindows/win32.c,
	  test/testparanoia.c: win32.c: was not indicating a failure when
	  reading the TOC failed.  testparanoia.c: better check that there
	  are drives.  device.c: I think better checking on drive
	  capability. At least we now	    check for the TOC failure case
	  and not add a drive there.

2005-01-14 Friday 04:26  Rocky Bernstein

	* test/testparanoia.c: Use a more statistical approach to
	  determining if cd-paranoia worked.  We still are really testing
	  the error correction part which may be the most interesting (and
	  useful).

2005-01-14 Friday 04:09  Rocky Bernstein

	* lib/cdda_interface/interface.c, test/testparanoia.c: Looked at
	  WAV spec format. Probably (but I'm not certain) the thing that
	  was wrong was the test program which needs to byte swap. What
	  confuses me now is how the media players sort this out.

2005-01-14 Friday 03:41  Rocky Bernstein

	* lib/cdda_interface/: interface.c, scan_devices.c: The sense I'm
	  getting is that while the bigendianp detection is clever, it
	  isn't complete. It may be that we need to use this along in
	  conjunctin with the endianness of the OS. That is instead of
	  big/little endian, what's needed is same/not same endian.

	  For now, the simplest thing is to just disable all of this and
	  wait to discover a CD-ROM drive where we have a problem.

2005-01-14 Friday 02:13  Rocky Bernstein

	* test/testparanoia.c: Spelling mistake.

2005-01-14 Friday 02:02  Rocky Bernstein

	* src/cd-paranoia/Makefile.am: I think I've finally got things
	  worked out so that usage.h gets created before it is needed.

2005-01-14 Friday 01:37  Rocky Bernstein

	* lib/paranoia/paranoia.c: Fix a couple memory leaks by freeing
	  resources.

2005-01-14 Friday 01:36  Rocky Bernstein

	* lib/cdda_interface/: common_interface.c, utils.c, utils.h:
	  Reinstate more of the libcdio routines.

2005-01-13 Thursday 21:38  Rocky Bernstein

	* lib/cdda_interface/: common_interface.c, utils.h: Put back
	  original cdparanoia byte-swapping routines until we smoke out
	  what's going wrong on cygwin.

2005-01-13 Thursday 19:39  Rocky Bernstein

	* lib/driver/MSWindows/win32_ioctl.c: Fix syntax error of last
	  commit

2005-01-13 Thursday 19:35  Rocky Bernstein

	  Update/add doxygen comments	add missing regression test output

2005-01-12 Wednesday 04:36  Rocky Bernstein

	* example/: Makefile.am, paranoia.c: Add an example of using
	  paranoia with libcdio.

2005-01-12 Wednesday 02:39  Rocky Bernstein

	* src/cd-paranoia/Makefile.am: I really don't understand how
	  Makefile's. Put in an explict dependency between usage.h and
	  usage.txt since the generic one isn't sufficient.

2005-01-11 Tuesday 10:51  Rocky Bernstein

	* src/cd-paranoia/Makefile.am: Install program and manpage
	  according to name specificed in --with-cdparnoia-name

2005-01-11 Tuesday 04:11  Rocky Bernstein

	* src/cd-paranoia/Makefile.am: 2nd try at getting tarball built
	  right. This time, ...

2005-01-11 Tuesday 04:05  Rocky Bernstein

	* src/cd-paranoia/Makefile.am: Missing two headers.

	  src/cd-paranoia/usage.txt.in, src/cd-paranoia/doc/FAQ.txt,
	  src/cd-paranoia/doc/overlapdef.txt: doc: add some paranoia
	  documentation.  src: Cleaner way to get usage and allow it to be
	  customized to a particular	  name configure.ac: add
	  --with-cd-paranoia-name to allow customization of the cd-paranoia
	  name.

	  More work is needed to get the binary renamed.

2005-01-11 Tuesday 00:34  Rocky Bernstein

	* lib/: driver/Makefile.am, iso9660/Makefile.am,
	  iso9660/libiso9660.sym: lib/{driver,iso9660}/Makefile.am: new
	  improved script for handling the case where there are no local
	  symbols (or global symbols).	libsio9660.sym: The last remaining
	  local symbol really should be global.

	  Change made on behalf of Nicolas Boullis.

2005-01-10 Monday 03:39  Rocky Bernstein

	* lib/cdda_interface/interface.c: Had commented out bigendiap
	  avoidance. Use - things go much faster.

2005-01-10 Monday 02:10  Rocky Bernstein

	* include/cdio/cdda.h, lib/cdda_interface/toc.c,
	  lib/paranoia/p_block.c: toc.c: don't assume first sector is 1.
	  cdda.h: document TOC better.	p_block.c: revise getting paranoia
	  first/last sector

2005-01-09 Sunday 17:30  Rocky Bernstein

	* src/cd-drive.c: Another slight error message change.

2005-01-09 Sunday 16:42  Rocky Bernstein

	  name to call this.  More accurate error message when
	  auto-detecting drive fails.

2005-01-09 Sunday 16:33  Rocky Bernstein

	* src/util.c: Some OS's (e.g. BSDI) have limitations on var_arg
	  routines. Accommodate this.

2005-01-09 Sunday 16:26  Rocky Bernstein

	* lib/driver/scsi_mmc.c, test/vcd_demo.right: scsi_mmc.c: style
	  differences. Need to do something about checking to make sure we
	  don't exceed the disc though.  vcd_demo.right: output has changed
	  yet again.

2005-01-09 Sunday 16:07  Rocky Bernstein

	  lib/driver/cdio.c, lib/driver/device.c, lib/driver/disc.c,
	  lib/driver/read.c, lib/driver/track.c: cdio.{c,h}: moved various
	  reading and device/driver routines out into the below read.{c,h}:
	  separate include for the reading routines.  disc.{c,h}: more
	  moved here from corresponding cdio.  device.c: a place for
	  device/driver related routines.  interface.c: break up line to
	  make debugging easier.

2005-01-09 Sunday 13:19  Rocky Bernstein

	  scanning failed.

2005-01-09 Sunday 12:32  Rocky Bernstein

	* lib/cdda_interface/: common_interface.c, common_interface.h: Got
	  BE and LE conversion backwards. Caused cdda-endianess
	  determination to fail.

2005-01-09 Sunday 01:50  Rocky Bernstein

	* lib/: cdda_interface/cooked_interface.c,
	  cdda_interface/drive_exceptions.h, cdda_interface/scan_devices.c,
	  driver/_cdio_sunos.c: Fix my recent breakage in adding back
	  GNU/Linux endian determination.  Need to seet nsectors if not
	  GNU/Linux. Some lint things for non-GNU/Linux.

2005-01-09 Sunday 00:47  Rocky Bernstein

	* lib/: cdda_interface/cooked_interface.c, driver/_cdio_sunos.c:
	  Fix a bad bug where we were requesting potentially a huge number
	  of blocks (-1 unsigned). Fix both the driver to disallow such a
	  nonsensical thing as well as just don't make the request.

2005-01-09 Sunday 00:12  Rocky Bernstein

	* lib/driver/cdio.c: Handle the case were we want to open only real
	  CD-ROM devices versus those where we're willing to open CD-images
	  and real CDs.

	  Don't know why I never fixed this earlier.

2005-01-09 Sunday 00:10  Rocky Bernstein

	* src/cd-drive.c, test/cdda-read.right, test/check_common_fn.in,
	  test/isofs-m1-read.right, src/cd-info.c, src/cd-read.c,
	  src/util.c, src/util.h: Create open_input() for common input open
	  routines.

	  Input error messages have been gone over. cd-read is a little
	  more like the rest.

	  Regression output now has NO-WARRANTY.

2005-01-08 Saturday 20:47  Rocky Bernstein

	* lib/cdda_interface/scan_devices.c: Compilation fix for
	  non-GNU/linux

2005-01-08 Saturday 20:39  Rocky Bernstein

	  lib/cdda_interface/interface.c,
	  lib/cdda_interface/scan_devices.c: Put back some of the
	  GNU/Linux-ism for detecting drive endian-ness.

	  The data-driven endian correction isn't working correctly.

	  Ultimately though this code should move down into libcdio (and
	  get removed from here.)

2005-01-08 Saturday 00:56  Rocky Bernstein

	* lib/cdda_interface/scan_devices.c: Better about handling non-Unix
	  devices.

	  read doesn't do it. (But I'm no sure why the read isn't doing
	  this properly.)

2005-01-06 Thursday 23:34  Rocky Bernstein

	* include/cdio/cdda.h: Doxygen documentatoin on more routines.
	  Remove some things that aren't useable any more.

	  independent.

	  win32_ioctl.c: more detailed info message.

2005-01-06 Thursday 13:10  Rocky Bernstein

	* src/cd-paranoia/cd-paranoia.1: Revise for libcdio's name

	  copy if not available.

2005-01-06 Thursday 10:56  Rocky Bernstein

	* src/Makefile.am: Fix bug in disabling building of utility
	  programs: cd-info, cd-read. Bug noticed by Steve Schultz.

2005-01-06 Thursday 04:09  Rocky Bernstein

	* lib/driver/_cdio_osx.c: Include code to save audio pre-emphasis,
	  # of tracks and copy-permit bit.  I think cd-paranoia may do
	  something now on Darwin.

2005-01-06 Thursday 03:38  Rocky Bernstein

	* lib/cdda_interface/: common_interface.h, cooked_interface.c,
	  interface.c, scan_devices.c, toc.c: More portability fixes. I
	  think this now does something on BSDI.

	  Move: lib/driver (split off of lib) lib/iso9660 (split off of

	  Add from paranoia: lib/cdda_interface lib/paranoia src/paranoia

	  Also made some small changes to capability indentification to
	  show more reading capabilties and show that.

	  cd-info now shows the total disc size.

2004-12-17 Friday 04:50  Rocky Bernstein

2004-12-06 Monday 05:30  Rocky Bernstein

2004-12-04 Saturday 05:49  Rocky Bernstein

	* lib/_cdio_linux.c: Justin B Ruggles <jruggle@earthlink.net>
	  reports:

	    GNU/Linux ioctl(.., CDROM_DISC_STATUS does not return "CD DATA
	  Form
	    2" for SVCD's when I know they are form 2, so we read a FULL
	  TOC in
	    an attempt to make it more accurate.  Most of the info was
	  obtained
	    the SCSI MMC draft spec revision 10a from
	    http://www.t10.org/ftp/t10/drafts/mmc/mmc-r10a.pdf

	    Pages 56 to 62 give more details.  Libcdio does not have CD-i
	  as a
	    discmode, so I just have it treat CD-i as if it is CD-XA.

	  This doesn't work for the SVCD I tried but it is probably a step
	  in the right direction. And when things settle down, it should be
	  done on other OS drivers as well.

	* include/cdio/cdio.h, lib/cdio.c, src/cd-drive.c, src/cd-info.c:
	  Add a couple of routines to pass back the driver used in getting
	  a drive.  Speeds up a little the task of opening the drive. Is
	  now used in cd-drive and cd-info.

2004-08-27 Friday 02:59  Rocky Bernstein

	* lib/_cdio_osx.c: Wrong access for setting drive capabilites to

	  lib/cdio_private.h, lib/scsi_mmc.c, src/cd-drive.c,

	  SCSI-MMC. This may help on OSX.

2004-08-27 Friday 01:24  Rocky Bernstein

	* lib/: _cdio_linux.c, scsi_mmc.c: scsi_mmc.c: more aggressive

	* lib/_cdio_osx.c: Save more IOkit information in private structure
	  and separate this from reading TOC.

	  Many small changes that I hope will eventually get us closer to
	  getting more drive and CD information although for now it doesn't
	  help all that much.

2004-08-19 Thursday 04:01  Rocky Bernstein

	* lib/_cdio_osx.c: Partial OSX improvements -- more work is needed.

2004-08-19 Thursday 02:50  Rocky Bernstein

	* configure.ac: Another attempt at a pkgconfig bug workaround

2004-08-19 Thursday 01:12  Rocky Bernstein

	* configure.ac, libcdio.pc.in: Fixes for making libcdio work with
	  pkg-config on Darwin when linking vcdimager and when linking just
	  libcdio. From Steven M. Schultz:

	    I blew a couple minutes tinkering with libcdio.pc and found
	  that
	    manually adding a quote character (not even a matched set of
	  quotes!)
	    around the second -framework was enough.

	    What works for now is manually editing libcdio.pc after it's
	  been
	    installed:

	     Libs: -L${libdir} -lcdio  -lm  -Wl,-framework
	  -Wl,CoreFoundation -Wl,-framework -Wl,IOKit

	    to:

	     Libs: -L${libdir} -lcdio  -lm  -Wl,-framework
	  -Wl,CoreFoundation "-Wl,-framework" -Wl,IOKit

	    is enough to get vcdimager compiled and linked.

	    Appears that the thing to do is somehow get the quotes into
	    libcdio.pc but not into $LIBS - or something like that at any
	  rate.

2004-08-18 Wednesday 11:31  Rocky Bernstein

	* lib/_cdio_osx.c: Make sure pp_scsiTaskDeviceInterface is
	  initialized. The code should probably be reorganized better for

2004-08-01 Sunday 11:28  Rocky Bernstein

	* lib/scsi_mmc.c: scsi_mmc.c: doc change

	  FreeBSD: use generic routines more often. Initialize TOC before

	* include/cdio/scsi_mmc.h, lib/_cdio_sunos.c, lib/scsi_mmc.c,
	  lib/scsi_mmc_private.h: Yet more alternate "_generic" to simplify
	  CD-ROM drivers (like all of them except Windows) were there is in
	  fact only one MMC passthrough command.

2004-07-27 Tuesday 01:36  Rocky Bernstein

	* lib/_cdio_sunos.c, test/vcd_demo.right: Compilation fixes. Added

2004-07-26 Monday 03:39  Rocky Bernstein

	* lib/: scsi_mmc.c, scsi_mmc_private.h: Start to break out routines
	  into a device-callable routine as well as a publically callable
	  routine. The device-callable routine will be able to change the
	  passthrough routine as M$ has two distinct routines for aspi and

	  lib/cdio.c, lib/cdio_private.h, lib/scsi_mmc.c,
	  lib/scsi_mmc_private.h: Big change!

	  We now are starting to have universal MMC routines. To do this we
	  need to have function pointers to the OS-specific MMC send/run
	  command.

	  Expect some breakage. Down the line though this will increase
	  code reuse, reliabilty, and make the library more
	  user-customizable.

2004-07-25 Sunday 20:59  Rocky Bernstein

	  Reduce overall number of CD disc modes. I thing the main purpose
	  that will be used is to separate CD Audio from CD Data, XA and
	  DVD's.

	  On GNU/Linux it seems that the implementation is a bit

	  Order of routines alphabetized a little bit better.

2004-07-25 Sunday 11:32  Rocky Bernstein

2004-06-19 Saturday 00:10  Rocky Bernstein

	* include/cdio/iso9660.h, lib/iso9660_fs.c, src/iso-info.c:
	  iso9660*.{c,h}: Add PVD read for ISO 9660 images.

	  iso-info now shows this info.

2004-06-18 Friday 23:00  Rocky Bernstein

	* include/cdio/iso9660.h, lib/iso9660.c: Add some trivial routines
	  to get volumeid, volumeset id, application id and system id.
	  Moved over from vcdimager.

	  Thanks to Stephan (mephisto..@...) for the suggestion.

2004-06-17 Thursday 10:41  Rocky Bernstein

	* lib/_cdio_osx.c: Ignore info where session is 0. At least for
	  now.

2004-06-17 Thursday 03:24  Rocky Bernstein

	* lib/_cdio_osx.c: Make sure we get TOC info for a single session.
	  For new we can really only deal with a single-session CD.

2004-06-17 Thursday 01:20  Rocky Bernstein

	* lib/_cdio_osx.c: Note OSX LBA is cdio LSN.

2004-06-17 Thursday 01:16  Rocky Bernstein

	* lib/_cdio_osx.c: Don't need to set i_leadout twice.

2004-06-17 Thursday 01:15  Rocky Bernstein

	* lib/_cdio_osx.c: getFirstrack_osx and getNumberOfTracks_osx do
	  duplicate scanning that could be done when looking for the
	  leadout track. Revised code to removes these routines,
	  consolidating the searching in one loop.

	  To be *very* conservative, a first loop finds the positions of
	  the leadout, first track and last track. This code then doesn't
	  assume that the track numbers are in order.  They could be given
	  track 3, 2, and then 1 or 2, 3, and then 1. Another loop then
	  maps first_track..last_track 0..number_of_tracks - 1

2004-06-16 Wednesday 04:51  Justin F. Hallett

	* lib/_cdio_osx.c: Works with all burnt media, bought media is
	  different some how.  Still better then it was since it didn't
	  work at all.

2004-06-14 Monday 08:18  Rocky Bernstein

	* lib/_cdio_osx.c: Wait a minute - the 0xa2 *is* larger than
	  CDIO_CD_MAX_TRACKS. But I guess we still should consider
	  ptrackDescriptors[i_descriptors].

2004-06-13 Sunday 21:43  Rocky Bernstein

	* lib/_cdio_osx.c: Probably more correct.

2004-06-13 Sunday 20:38  Rocky Bernstein

	* lib/_cdio_sunos.c: Move include of glob.h inside conditional
	  Solaris include since that's only where it is needed. configure
	  on cygwin erroneously sets HAVE_GLOB_H and although that too
	  should be fixed, there's no reason to have that failure cause one
	  here.

2004-06-12 Saturday 17:33  Rocky Bernstein

	* configure.ac: Allow FreeBSD 5.X: Heiner says it sort of works.

2004-06-12 Saturday 17:32  Rocky Bernstein

2004-06-11 Friday 02:22  Rocky Bernstein

	* configure.ac: It is a tad nicer to switch off

	  give and error and halt.

2004-06-07 Monday 00:24  Rocky Bernstein

2004-06-06 Sunday 11:51  Rocky Bernstein

2004-06-06 Sunday 11:25  Rocky Bernstein

	  need to fix the MCN code.

2004-06-01 Tuesday 03:44  Justin F. Hallett

	* lib/_cdio_osx.c: Now knows the difference between DATA and Audio

2004-05-31 Monday 15:21  Justin F. Hallett

	* configure.ac, lib/_cdio_osx.c: Fix compile on OS X 10.3, should
	  work on 10.2 and 10.3, still testing for 10.1, OS X Drivers still
	  incomplete this is just to fix compiling.

2004-05-31 Monday 14:52  Rocky Bernstein

	* src/cd-read.c: Make sure source_name a malloc'd, so we can
	  uniformly free it when not needed.

2004-05-31 Monday 13:32  Rocky Bernstein

	* test/: check_nrg.sh.in, svcdgs.right: check_nrg.sh.in: add NRG

2004-05-31 Monday 12:29  Rocky Bernstein

	* lib/: _cdio_generic.c, _cdio_linux.c, _cdio_sunos.c: Hopefully

2004-05-31 Monday 12:19  Rocky Bernstein

	* src/cd-info.c: Handle error reporting with null source correctly.

2004-05-31 Monday 11:50  Rocky Bernstein

	* test/vcd_demo.right: Added another 0 to MSF output. (Having 2nd

	  places.)

2004-05-31 Monday 11:44  Rocky Bernstein

	* test/cdda-mcn.right: NRG MCN CDDA test.

2004-05-31 Monday 04:00  Rocky Bernstein

2004-05-27 Thursday 10:58  Rocky Bernstein

	* lib/_cdio_linux.c: Remove some of the bogosity in assuming the
	  first track starts at 1.  (Probably will be useful on
	  multi-session CD's).

2004-05-27 Thursday 10:47  Rocky Bernstein

2004-05-16 Sunday 13:33  Rocky Bernstein

	* src/cd-info.c: MSWindows/*: get access mode working better. ASPI
	  support is faulty though

	  freebsd.c: it's "ioctl" not "IOCTL"; cdrdao: it's cdrdao, not
	  "toc" cd-info: slightly better error message?

2004-05-13 Thursday 04:32  Rocky Bernstein

	* lib/_cdio_linux.c: Go over FreeBSD code based on output from
	  Heiner.  Hopefully 3 bugs are fixed:	 - we get the leadout track
	  now, no core dumps   - MSF reporting is corrected   - track
	  format and mode

	  _cdio_linux.c: use cdio #define rather than GNU/Linux one.

	* include/cdio/cdio.h, lib/_cdio_generic.c, lib/cdio.c,

2004-03-16 Tuesday 12:18  Rocky Bernstein

	* lib/_cdio_sunos.c: From Ian MacIntosh:

	  Modifications that it doesn't use the uscsi commands anymore and
	  so all IDE and SCSI drives go through the same code path - a
	  major simplification.

	  This works with all the CD drives that work with Solaris (IDE or
	  SCSI) as the ioctl's for CDROMCDXA in Solaris just end up doing
	  uscsi calls anyway, but directly from the kernel. The added
	  advantage of not using uscsi is that the user doesn't need to be
	  root - which is important in Sunray environments.

2004-03-13 Saturday 03:32  Rocky Bernstein

	  might have broken cygwin when -mno-cygwin isn't used. We'll see.

2004-03-10 Wednesday 10:57  Rocky Bernstein

	* lib/cdio.c: ioctl: printf lint for cygwin (and perhaps others)

2004-03-09 Tuesday 02:55  Rocky Bernstein

2004-03-07 Sunday 11:43  Rocky Bernstein

2004-02-28 Saturday 12:45  Rocky Bernstein

	* NEWS: Note library symbol versioning (from Nicolas Boullis).

2004-02-12 Thursday 01:46  Rocky Bernstein

	* lib/Makefile.am: code reorganization from Nicolas Boullis.

2004-02-11 Wednesday 03:09  Rocky Bernstein

	* lib/Makefile.am: lib/Makefile.am (Nicolas Boullis):

	  Mostly some cleanup... First, this tries to keep the versioning
	  separated from the rest of the Makefile. I used the "foo :=
	  $(foo) bar" syntax rather than "foo += bar" as I think the += is
	  not available on all versions of make.

	  Moreover, I replaced "$(LIBCDIO_LIBS)" with "libcdio.la" as
	  "$(LIBCDIO_LIBS)" is "../lib/libcdio.la". That make a difference
	  if you try to build libiso9660.la while libcdio.la is not
	  available. Make knows how to make libcdio.la but not
	  ../lib/libcdio.la.

2004-02-11 Wednesday 02:53  Rocky Bernstein

	* lib/.cvsignore: Igore library version file.

2004-02-10 Tuesday 01:38  Rocky Bernstein

	  Many thanks to Nicolas Boullis.

2004-02-04 Wednesday 10:23  Rocky Bernstein

	* lib/: Makefile.am, _cdio_win32.c, _cdio_win32.h, win32ioctl.c:
	  Add better DeviceIocontrol support. It still sucks, but sucks
	  less.

	* lib/_cdio_nrg.c: Some code consolidation.

2003-12-31 Wednesday 03:09  Rocky Bernstein

	* doc/Makefile.am, include/cdio/iso9660.h, lib/iso9660_fs.c,
	  src/cd-info.c: iso9600_stat now has filename inside it.
	  iso9660_fs_readdir now returns a list of iso9660_stat_t's rather
	  than filenames.

	  This should reduce by a small amount the number of CD reads since
	  we store more information in the iso9660_fs_readdir return.

	  However all of this is in preparation for greatly reducing the
	  number of CD reads when picking out segment lsn information.

2003-11-11 Tuesday 12:46  Rocky Bernstein

	* doc/libcdio.texi: libcdio.info was missing a @dircategory and

2003-11-10 Monday 04:01  Rocky Bernstein

	* include/cdio/iso9660.h, lib/iso9660_fs.c: Smallish cosmetic

	  vcdimager here.  More prototypes are "const CdIo *".

2003-09-01 Monday 22:51  Rocky Bernstein

	* lib/_cdio_bincue.c: Test for NULL binfile - as odd as this
	  sounds, it could cause core dump if no CD loaded.

2003-09-01 Monday 22:50  Rocky Bernstein

	* configure.ac: Remove -Wsign-promo which is not relevant for C
	  programs.

2003-09-01 Monday 22:31  Rocky Bernstein

2003-09-01 Monday 19:25  Rocky Bernstein

	* libcdio.spec.in: Translation kindly and graceously provided by
	  Manfred Tremmel

2003-09-01 Monday 16:02  Rocky Bernstein

	* lib/: _cdio_bsdi.c, _cdio_freebsd.c, _cdio_linux.c,
	  _cdio_sunos.c: Note TOC's initialized so we don't reread. Add
	  some int's to unsigned.

2003-09-01 Monday 15:10  Rocky Bernstein

	* include/cdio/iso9660.h, lib/iso9660.c: Start to document library
	  routines. An "int" was changed to the more correct "bool".

	  iso9660 library.

2003-09-01 Monday 02:08  Rocky Bernstein

	* include/cdio/iso9660.h, include/cdio/xa.h, lib/iso9660_private.h:
	  Merge in and tidy up with mkisofs's iso9660.h. If that is correct

2003-09-01 Monday 02:07  Rocky Bernstein

	* configure.ac: Wrong AC_SUBST variable for CDDB.

2003-09-01 Monday 02:05  Rocky Bernstein

	  dependencies to latest versions of packages which is really
	  needed.

2003-09-01 Monday 02:04  Rocky Bernstein

	* src/cd-info.c: Have to rely more on other XA test since track
	  indicator seems faulty.  Missing "break;" in switch caused us to
	  not print iso9660 filesystems.

2003-09-01 Monday 02:02  Rocky Bernstein

	* test/: check_cue.sh.in, check_nrg.sh.in: Was setting options all
	  wrong and using wrong CDDB subtitution variable.  As Bullwinkle
	  says, "This time, for sure!"

2003-09-01 Monday 02:02  Rocky Bernstein

	* lib/_cdio_linux.c: Wasn't noting that we read TOC so we were
	  re-reading it every time.

2003-08-31 Sunday 20:56  Rocky Bernstein

	* src/cd-info.c: Deal with gcc warning. Think it was spurious, but
	  just in case.

2003-08-31 Sunday 20:52  Rocky Bernstein

	* Makefile.am, THANKS, libcdio.spec.in: Fixes from Frantisek Dvorak
	  <valtri@atlas.cz>

	  lib/iso9660_fs.c, lib/xa.c, lib/xa.h, src/cd-info.c,
	  test/cdda.right, test/check_cue.sh.in, test/check_nrg.sh.in,
	  test/monvoisin.right, test/vcd_demo.right: I think I have the XA
	  encapsulation down so that it will work in vcdimager (and
	  others).

2003-08-31 Sunday 08:03  Rocky Bernstein

	* configure.ac: Rely more on PKG_INFO and remove header checks
	  which didn't test for --enable-xxx.

2003-08-31 Sunday 07:39  Rocky Bernstein

	* include/cdio/: Makefile.am, iso9660.h, xa.h: Separate and make XA
	  information public.

	  test/svcd_ogt_test_ntsc.right, test/svcdgs.right,
	  test/vcd_demo.right, test/videocd.right: Move over reading
	  ISO-9660 filesytems from vcdimager. Handling of XA attributes
	  also moved over.

2003-08-31 Sunday 05:00  Rocky Bernstein

	* include/cdio/iso9660.h, lib/iso9660.c, lib/iso9660_private.h,
	  test/check_sizeof.c: Expose primary volume descriptor (pvd) and
	  directory structures since they *are* part of the spec. and be
	  done with it.

2003-08-31 Sunday 04:02  Rocky Bernstein

	* src/cd-info.c: A tad closer to being able to print ISO-9660
	  filesystems

2003-08-31 Sunday 03:35  Rocky Bernstein

	* include/cdio/iso9660.h, lib/cd_types.c, lib/iso9660_private.h:
	  cd_types: tighter use of ISO #defines.  Make some of the private
	  ones public to reduce "private" use in vcdimager.

2003-08-31 Sunday 02:51  Rocky Bernstein

	* include/cdio/iso9660.h, lib/iso9660.c, src/cd-info.c:

	* configure.ac, include/cdio/iso9660.h, include/cdio/types.h,
	  lib/iso9660.c: Opaque type declaration for iso9660 moved into
	  well iso9660.h (from cdio/types.h). Opaque type for
	  iso_directory_record defined and access routines added to
	  libiso9660.

2003-08-14 Thursday 13:41  Rocky Bernstein

	* src/: Makefile.am, analyze.c, analyze.h, cd-info.c: First cut at

2003-08-10 Sunday 02:27  Rocky Bernstein

	* configure.ac, src/Makefile.am, src/cd-info.c: Changes brought

	  configure.   - Remove reference to info_private.h.

2003-08-09 Saturday 11:52  Rocky Bernstein

	* Makefile.am, doc/Makefile.am, example/sample1.c,
	  example/sample2.c: *Makefile/am Get sample documentation is in

	* doc/libcdio.texi: typo.

2003-07-30 Wednesday 02:05  Rocky Bernstein

	* doc/libcdio.texi: More verbiage. Alas not on how to use *this*
	  package, but we are getting there if by virtue of not being able
	  to postpone it too much more.

2003-07-28 Monday 10:46  Rocky Bernstein

	* doc/libcdio.texi: Small additions and edits.

2003-07-28 Monday 02:25  Rocky Bernstein

	* Makefile.am, configure.ac, doc/Makefile.am, doc/libcdio.texi:
	  First feeble attempt at documentation.

2003-07-27 Sunday 22:52  Rocky Bernstein

	* include/cdio/cdio.h, lib/cdio.c, lib/cdio_private.h,
	  src/cd-info.c: MIN_DRIVER, MIN_DEVICE_DRIVER, MAX_DEVICE_DRIVER
	  -> CDIO_...  Add CDIO_MAX_DRIVER (distinct from
	  CDIO_MAX_DEVICE_DRIVER

	  cdio.c (cdio_open): was only scanning devices. Change to scan
	  disk image files as well.

2003-06-13 Friday 04:47  Rocky Bernstein

	* configure.ac: Order of libraries is important in cygwin (and
	  perhaps others): -lvcdinfo comes before -lvcd.

2003-06-13 Friday 04:36  Rocky Bernstein

	* src/cd-info.c: Now use cdio enum rather than vcd enum for unknown
	  driver type.

	* lib/_cdio_generic.c, lib/_cdio_linux.c, lib/cdio_private.h,
	  src/cd-info.c: Make GNU/Linux smarter about finding a default

	  around.

2003-06-12 Thursday 03:38  Rocky Bernstein

	* lib/_cdio_win32.c: Pedantic change: subroutine name is probably
	  better.

2003-06-11 Wednesday 10:57  Rocky Bernstein

	* include/cdio/cdio.h, lib/cdio.c, src/Makefile.am: Enumeration had
	  grew but hadn't changed string array accordingly.

	* configure.ac, test/check_common_fn.in: Better way to deal with
	  diff vs. cmp and diff options.

2003-06-08 Sunday 12:33  Rocky Bernstein

	* configure.ac, test/check_common_fn, test/check_common_fn.in: Use
	  diff rather than cmp if possible. Also if possible do a unified
	  diff and for M$DOG strip whitespace for the \r\n vs \n
	  differences.

2003-06-07 Saturday 22:16  Rocky Bernstein

	* src/cd-info.c: Reverting change (for now).

2003-06-07 Saturday 22:13  Rocky Bernstein

	* src/cd-info.c: Is this right?

2003-06-07 Saturday 22:11  Rocky Bernstein

	* lib/_cdio_win32.c: More bugs. By far not the last of them
	  though....

2003-06-07 Saturday 20:42  Rocky Bernstein

	* include/cdio/cdio.h, lib/_cdio_win32.c, lib/cdio.c: With M$ we
	  can no longer assume we can open a fd ant it will read properly.

	  There's lots of cleanup to do...

2003-06-07 Saturday 20:41  Rocky Bernstein

	* test/: cdda.right, check_common_fn, check_opts0.right,
	  check_opts1.right, check_opts2.right, check_opts3.right,
	  check_opts4.right, check_opts5.right, check_opts6.right,

2003-06-07 Saturday 20:40  Rocky Bernstein

	* src/cd-info.c: Add option to nuke header for regression tests.
	  With M$ can no longer assume file descriptors do the right thing.

2003-06-07 Saturday 16:53  Rocky Bernstein

	* include/cdio/cdio.h, lib/_cdio_win32.c, lib/cdio.c: More MinGW

2003-06-01 Sunday 21:05  Rocky Bernstein

	* configure.ac, src/Makefile.am, src/cd-info.c: Require libcddb
	  0.9.4 or nothing at all. We now allow: - setting cache directory
	  - disabling caching altogther - setting timeout on CDDB network
	  operations - setting email address reported to CDDB server -
	  setting name of CDDB server - printing/suppressing messages from
	  CDDB

2003-05-30 Friday 10:58  Rocky Bernstein

	  lib/Makefile.am, lib/_cdio_win32.c, lib/cdio.c, parse/.cvsignore:
	  Closer to having WIN32 CD-ROM support

2003-05-27 Tuesday 02:22  Rocky Bernstein

	* lib/_cdio_freebsd.c: Miscellaneous constant changes and typos

2003-05-26 Monday 03:11  Rocky Bernstein

	* include/cdio/sector.h: more pedantic types (which in fact match
	  the implimentation).

2003-05-25 Sunday 10:35  Rocky Bernstein

	* lib/_cdio_freebsd.c: Another small comment correction

2003-05-25 Sunday 10:34  Rocky Bernstein

	* lib/_cdio_freebsd.c: small eject comment correction

2003-05-24 Saturday 15:46  Rocky Bernstein

	* test/videocd.nrg: Test NRG file.

2003-05-20 Tuesday 08:10  Rocky Bernstein

	* configure.ac: Solaris needs -lnsl and -lgethostbyname for libcddb

2003-05-20 Tuesday 07:56  Rocky Bernstein

	* lib/_cdio_bincue.c: Wrong name: was testing uninit variable.

2003-05-20 Tuesday 07:35  Rocky Bernstein

	* configure.ac: Get ready for version 0.6

2003-05-18 Sunday 02:31  Rocky Bernstein

	* test/check_cue.sh.in: Add a test using --bin

2003-05-18 Sunday 02:28  Rocky Bernstein

	  box doesn't have.

2003-05-16 Friday 21:11  Rocky Bernstein

	* test/check_nrg.sh.in: BSDI doesn't handle skipped tests (exit 77)
	  properly. I'd rather switch than fight.

2003-05-16 Friday 07:36  Rocky Bernstein

	* lib/cdio.c: Wasn't nulling correctly. Eject test faulty too.

2003-05-16 Friday 07:18  Rocky Bernstein

	  lib/_cdio_linux.c, lib/_cdio_sunos.c, lib/cdio.c, parse/Makefile:

2003-04-28 Monday 02:08  Rocky Bernstein

	* test/.cvsignore: Do I trust Savannah?

2003-04-28 Monday 02:02  Rocky Bernstein

	* test/: Makefile.am, check_nrg.sh, check_nrg.sh.in: check_nrg.sh

	  cd-info: Use libvcdinfo if it is around to list out general Video
	  CD properties (format version, album description, preparer id,
	  volume number and count). cd-info output changed slightly.

2003-04-25 Friday 21:28  Rocky Bernstein

	* Makefile.am, src/Makefile.am, src/cd-info.c, src/cdinfo.c,
	  test/check_common_fn, test/check_opts.sh: rename cdinfo to
	  cd-info to accomodate previously existing cdinfo programs.

	  test.

2003-04-23 Wednesday 22:05  Rocky Bernstein

	* lib/_cdio_nrg.c, test/svcdgs.right: More blind guesses to CUES
	  format. Still wrong, but works better on the one sample I have to
	  go on: svcdgs.nrg.

2003-04-22 Tuesday 12:40  Rocky Bernstein

	* configure.ac, include/cdio/Makefile.am: Wasn't installing
	  version.h. This time, for sure!

2003-04-22 Tuesday 02:48  Rocky Bernstein

	* lib/_cdio_freebsd.c: Probably closer.

2003-04-22 Tuesday 01:34  Rocky Bernstein

	* Makefile.am: Update regression version.

2003-04-21 Monday 23:30  Rocky Bernstein

	* TODO: Where we might be going...

2003-04-21 Monday 23:28  Rocky Bernstein

	* .cvsignore: Now that we're using pkg-config.

2003-04-21 Monday 23:27  Rocky Bernstein

	* include/cdio/cdio.h.in: Simple typo.

2003-04-21 Monday 23:24  Rocky Bernstein

	* lib/_cdio_nrg.c: Probably much closer to being able to handle
	  Nero CUES format. Seems to have 2336 sector size; 2 second pregap
	  seems to be included at the beginning of the image.

2003-04-21 Monday 23:20  Rocky Bernstein

	* src/cdinfo.c: Add tests for CVD. A lot of this probably should be
	  redone. For example, should get basic Video CD info from
	  libvcdinfo if that is around.

2003-04-21 Monday 14:13  Herbert Valerio Riedel

	* include/cdio/: Makefile.am, logging.h, sector.h: public headers

2003-04-21 Monday 10:17  Herbert Valerio Riedel

	* Makefile.am, configure.ac, libcdio.pc.in, include/cdio/cdio.h.in:
	  added pkg-config(1) support

	* include/cdio/.cvsignore: CVS maintenance

2003-04-20 Sunday 17:24  Rocky Bernstein

	* configure.ac, include/cdio/cdio.h, include/cdio/cdio.h.in,
	  src/cdinfo.c: Reduce overall size yet again by replaing isofs-m1
	  for fsf-tompox.  cdinfo: Add options for CDDB port and CDDB http
	  enable	 fix bug if no CD in cdrom drive.

	* include/cdio/cdio.h: add min/max device driver

2003-04-20 Sunday 15:34  Rocky Bernstein

	* Makefile.am, configure.ac, lib/cdio.c: Add small cdda test.
	  cdio.c: cdio_open was opening image drivers.

2003-04-20 Sunday 01:39  Rocky Bernstein

	* configure.ac, lib/Makefile.am, src/cdinfo.c: Put back in libcddb
	  0.9.0 checking and use cddb_http_disable().

2003-04-19 Saturday 20:49  Rocky Bernstein

	* lib/_cdio_freebsd.c: Add _cdio_read_audio_sector. Try to sync up
	  with other drivers.

2003-04-19 Saturday 19:12  Rocky Bernstein

	* Makefile.am, NEWS, configure.ac: Break most of the larger
	  regression tests into a separate package.

2003-04-19 Saturday 09:13  Rocky Bernstein

	* include/cdio/: Makefile.am, cdio.h, cdio.h.in: Add package
	  version

2003-04-19 Saturday 09:02  Rocky Bernstein

	* include/cdio/cdio.h: Add an API version number.

2003-04-19 Saturday 08:29  Rocky Bernstein

	* Makefile.am, configure.ac, include/.cvsignore,
	  include/Makefile.am, include/cdio/.cvsignore,
	  include/cdio/Makefile.am, include/cdio/cdio.h,
	  include/cdio/logging.h, include/cdio/sector.h,
	  include/cdio/types.h, include/cdio/util.h, lib/Makefile.am,
	  lib/cdio.h, lib/logging.h, lib/sector.h, lib/types.h, lib/util.h,
	  src/cdinfo.c: Move public includes to include/cdio. This should
	  facilitate having this source installed locally since it allows
	  #include <cdio/cdio.h> in the source tree.

2003-04-19 Saturday 00:53  Rocky Bernstein

	* src/cdinfo.c: Revise to to handle libcddb 0.90.

2003-04-19 Saturday 00:52  Rocky Bernstein

	* lib/cdio.h: Remove a compile warning noticed by Kris Verbeeck.

2003-04-19 Saturday 00:50  Rocky Bernstein

	* configure.ac: do chmod +x for test/check_opts.sh Test to see if
	  we have new enough libcddb.

2003-04-19 Saturday 00:49  Rocky Bernstein

	* README: Update to include CDDB information and note this is ued
	  by CD-DA plugin.

2003-04-15 Tuesday 05:19  Rocky Bernstein

	* lib/_cdio_linux.c: Remove compile warning on non-GNU/Linux
	  servers.

2003-04-14 Monday 23:30  Rocky Bernstein

	* THANKS: Need to start *somewhere*.

2003-04-14 Monday 23:29  Rocky Bernstein

	* NEWS: Wha's happenin'

2003-04-14 Monday 23:11  Rocky Bernstein

	* lib/_cdio_bincue.c: Bug-causing typo.

2003-04-14 Monday 10:03  Rocky Bernstein

	* configure.ac: Need to conditionally add --no-cddb so we added
	  check_opts.sh.in.  Rewrite for loop in lower-level Bourne-shell
	  style.

2003-04-14 Monday 10:01  Rocky Bernstein

	* src/cdinfo.c: One cddb reference not conditionally included.

2003-04-14 Monday 04:58  Rocky Bernstein

	* src/cdinfo.c: libpopt options need to be integers. Change order
	  of include to accomodate libcddb. Make distcheck now works.

2003-04-14 Monday 04:29  Rocky Bernstein

	* src/Makefile.am: Add CDDB_LIB for cdinfo.

2003-04-14 Monday 04:29  Rocky Bernstein

	* configure.ac: Check for libcddb and use that if it's there.

2003-04-14 Monday 04:27  Rocky Bernstein

	* lib/_cdio_bincue.c: If we don't think this is a cue file, we now
	  report that rather than give the cryptic message about a null
	  source.

2003-04-14 Monday 04:26  Rocky Bernstein

	* src/cdinfo.c: CDDB lookup for audio CD via libcddb.

2003-04-14 Monday 04:24  Rocky Bernstein

	* lib/cdio.c: Bad linux default_device initialization.

2003-04-12 Saturday 03:38  Rocky Bernstein

	* lib/: _cdio_bincue.c, _cdio_bsdi.h, cdio.c, cdio.h: Add routine
	  cdio_is_bincue to test if file is a cue file.  cdio_open does a
	  better job in automatically determining the type of file.

2003-04-11 Friday 17:33  Rocky Bernstein

	* lib/: sector.c, sector.h: Tired of all those unused warings.
	  Remove the static inline stuff.  It's probably not worth the
	  performance gains. (And if it is we can turn into a #define)

2003-04-11 Friday 17:31  Rocky Bernstein

	* lib/_cdio_sunos.c: Move used #include <string.h> outside of
	  conditional compilation since strdup's used to get default
	  device.

2003-04-11 Friday 17:30  Rocky Bernstein

	* lib/: _cdio_bincue.c, _cdio_nrg.c: Forgot to add recently added
	  read_audio_sector to op structure.

2003-04-10 Thursday 07:22  Rocky Bernstein

	* configure.ac, lib/_cdio_bincue.c, lib/_cdio_nrg.c: configure.ac:
	  bump version bincue/nrg: add cdio_read_audio_sector

2003-04-10 Thursday 07:19  Rocky Bernstein

	* lib/_cdio_sunos.c: read_mode_audio_sector now works.

2003-04-10 Thursday 04:13  Rocky Bernstein

	* lib/: _cdio_bincue.c, _cdio_bsdi.c, _cdio_freebsd.c,
	  _cdio_generic.c, _cdio_nrg.c, _cdio_sunos.c, cdio.c, cdio.h,
	  cdio_private.h: get_default_device with NULL will get device
	  *without* trying to open cd. Add read_audio call.

2003-04-10 Thursday 04:11  Rocky Bernstein

	* lib/_cdio_linux.c: Add ability to read audio (CD-DA) sector.

2003-04-10 Thursday 04:10  Rocky Bernstein

	* lib/types.h: Add CDIO_INVALID_LSN definition

2003-04-09 Wednesday 11:15  Rocky Bernstein

	* lib/sector.h: CD_MAX_TRACKS -> CDIO_CD_MAX_TRACKS

2003-04-08 Tuesday 21:12  Rocky Bernstein

	* lib/_cdio_linux.c: Small name changes.

2003-04-08 Tuesday 10:35  Rocky Bernstein

	* lib/_cdio_bsdi.c: Changes brought about by sector.h #define
	  changes.

2003-04-08 Tuesday 10:17  Rocky Bernstein

	* lib/_cdio_sunos.c: Revise for changed sector.h

2003-04-07 Monday 11:31  Rocky Bernstein

	* lib/cdio_private.h: Add opaque CdIoDataSource type and generic
	  free routine for stream-based drivers (nrg, bincue, network).

2003-04-07 Monday 11:29  Rocky Bernstein

	* lib/types.h: Indention formatting that Emacs prefers.

2003-04-07 Monday 11:25  Rocky Bernstein

	* lib/_cdio_nrg.c: Sync up with _cdio_bincue a little. free routine
	  replaced with a generic routine.

2003-04-07 Monday 11:24  Rocky Bernstein

	* lib/_cdio_bincue.c: Move free routine into a generic routine.
	  Some numbers replaced by #define constants.

2003-04-07 Monday 11:24  Rocky Bernstein

	* lib/_cdio_generic.c: Add generic_stream_free and remove out of
	  disk-image routines.

2003-04-07 Monday 11:23  Rocky Bernstein

	* lib/_cdio_stream.h: Opaque type CdioDataSource is now in
	  cdio_private.h. This forces us to use that. (And this might not
	  be the best, but I can't think of anything else that is as
	  simple.)

2003-04-07 Monday 03:05  Rocky Bernstein

	* lib/_cdio_stream.c: Grammar typo.

2003-04-07 Monday 02:58  Rocky Bernstein

	* lib/_cdio_bincue.c: Another case of not checking the status of
	  operations and returning on error (rather than continuing). Not
	  serious this time...

2003-04-07 Monday 02:41  Rocky Bernstein

	* lib/_cdio_bincue.c: Propagate error results from seeks and reads.

2003-04-06 Sunday 23:40  Rocky Bernstein

	* lib/: _cdio_stdio.c, _cdio_stream.c, _cdio_stream.h: Document
	  some of the interfaces.

2003-04-06 Sunday 23:09  Rocky Bernstein

	* lib/_cdio_bincue.c: Back off a little with the #define thing a
	  little for now. I made a mistake somewhere.  (And don't want to
	  track it down further.)

2003-04-06 Sunday 18:26  Rocky Bernstein

	* lib/sector.h: This time for sure?

2003-04-06 Sunday 18:12  Rocky Bernstein

	* lib/_cdio_generic.c, lib/_cdio_linux.c, lib/_cdio_nrg.c,
	  lib/sector.h, src/cdinfo.c: More #define reductions/fixes.

2003-04-06 Sunday 17:57  Rocky Bernstein

	* lib/_cdio_bincue.c, lib/_cdio_bsdi.c, lib/_cdio_bsdi_old.c,
	  lib/_cdio_linux.c, lib/_cdio_nrg.c, lib/_cdio_stream.c,
	  lib/_cdio_sunos.c, lib/sector.h, src/cdinfo.c: Change sector.h
	  constants, yet again. This time for Herbert Valiero Riedel.

2003-04-06 Sunday 06:46  Rocky Bernstein

	* src/cdinfo.c: Use new sector.h constants.

2003-04-06 Sunday 06:45  Rocky Bernstein

	* lib/: _cdio_linux.c, _cdio_nrg.c, _cdio_sunos.c, cdio.h:
	  Use new sector.h constants. More changes will no doubt follow.

2003-04-06 Sunday 06:44  Rocky Bernstein

	* lib/_cdio_bincue.c: More complete. Fill out seek code.

2003-04-06 Sunday 06:43  Rocky Bernstein

	* lib/sector.h: Go with Linux definitions rather than invent our
	  own. More changes will no doubt follow.

2003-04-04 Friday 05:15  Rocky Bernstein

	* lib/: _cdio_bincue.c, cdio_private.h: Close go getting simple
	  read working. Not completely correct, but close.

2003-04-04 Friday 00:41  Rocky Bernstein

	* lib/: cdio.c, cdio.h: Documentation improvment: Note that
	  get_default_device returns NULL on error.

2003-04-03 Thursday 12:16  Rocky Bernstein

	* lib/: Makefile.am, _cdio_stream.h, bytesex.h, bytesex_asm.h,
	  cdio.h, cdio_assert.h, cdio_types.h, ds.c, ds.h, logging.h,
	  sector.h, types.h: cdio_types.h -> types.h

2003-04-02 Wednesday 14:54  Rocky Bernstein

	* lib/cdio.c: Note that device is uninit when destroying, 'cause it
	  is!

2003-03-30 Sunday 13:01  Rocky Bernstein

	* lib/: _cdio_bincue.c, _cdio_bsdi.c, _cdio_generic.c,
	  _cdio_linux.c, _cdio_nrg.c, _cdio_sunos.c, cdio.c, cdio.h,
	  cdio_private.h: More common routiens and structures moved to
	  cdio_generic.c or cdio_private.h respectively.

2003-03-30 Sunday 12:59  Rocky Bernstein

	* configure.ac: BSDI now requires Steve Schultz's libdvd.a and
	  dvd.h package.

2003-03-30 Sunday 01:31  Rocky Bernstein

	* configure.ac: Having trouble getting aclocal include libpopt.m4
	  (and presumably other *.m4's)

2003-03-30 Sunday 01:11  Rocky Bernstein

	* autogen.sh, configure.ac, src/Makefile.am: Rest: add libpopt
	  autoconfiguration.

2003-03-30 Sunday 01:11  Rocky Bernstein

	* lib/_cdio_bsdi.c: Extend to larger interface using generic
	  routines.

2003-03-30 Sunday 00:40  Rocky Bernstein

	* lib/_cdio_freebsd.c: Yet another typo.

2003-03-30 Sunday 00:38  Rocky Bernstein

	* lib/: _cdio_bincue.c, _cdio_generic.c, _cdio_nrg.c,
	  _cdio_sunos.c: Small lint-like errors. Solaris now works again
	  with new read/lseek functions.

2003-03-29 Saturday 20:28  Rocky Bernstein

	* lib/: _cdio_freebsd.c, _cdio_sunos.c: Probably closer towards
	  compiling on those architectures.

2003-03-29 Saturday 17:32  Rocky Bernstein

	* configure.ac, lib/Makefile.am, lib/_cdio_bincue.c,
	  lib/_cdio_bsdi.c, lib/_cdio_bsdi_old.c, lib/_cdio_freebsd.c,
	  lib/_cdio_generic.c, lib/_cdio_linux.c, lib/_cdio_nrg.c,

	  lib/cdio_types.h, lib/sector.h, src/Makefile.am, src/cdinfo.c:
	  Add simple (non-mode2) read/seek.  _cdio_generic.c: place to save
	  common driver routines add cdio_get_track_sec_count.

2003-03-25 Tuesday 02:10  Rocky Bernstein

	* src/cdinfo.c: gcc < 3.0 compatibility.

2003-03-25 Tuesday 00:00  Rocky Bernstein
