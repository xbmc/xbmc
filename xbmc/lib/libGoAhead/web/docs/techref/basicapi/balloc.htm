</table><h2>Description</h2><p>The balloc procedure creates and allocates a block of dynamic memory for use 
  by the caller. When finished, you should use <a href="bfree.htm">bfree</a> to 
  release the block. Balloc is a very efficient memory allocation that uses binary 
  queues to store blocks of memory. It does not do block coalescing, nor does 
  it attempt to eliminate fragmentation. Once released by bfree, memory is not 
  actually freed to the operating system, but is kept on the relevant binary queue 
  for future use by the application. Use B_L as the first argument to bfree to 
  provide the source file name and line number arguments.</p><p>The goal of the balloc memory allocator is to provide guaranteed, rapid allocation. 
  By calling <a href="bopen.htm">bopen</a> with the application memory requirements, 
  memory can be defined or allocated upfront and subsequent calls to balloc are 
  more likely to succeed. Balloc is not perfect. You can still get free memory 
  on one class queue while memory requests for a large size cannot be satisfied. 
  However, in practice, many embedded applications tend to allocate memory in 
  a pattern and the balloc memory allocator works well in such environments. The 
  memory usage of the GoAhead WebServer has been optimized to allocate from the 
  fixed pool defined by bopen, and it should be very predictable in its requirements. 
  The bstats procedure may be used to print out current memory statistics include 
  per file usage information.</p><h2>Return Value</h2><p>Pointer to the allocated buffer. If memory cannot be provided, NULL is
returned.</p><h2>Example</h2><pre>
buf = balloc(B_L, 1024);
gstrncpy(buf, &quot;Hello World&quot;, sizeof(buf));
bfree(B_L, buf);
