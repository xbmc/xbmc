0.18 - 1/27/05 - added AST (PCM) support, experimenting with AFC support

0.17 - 1/13/05 - added RSD support (DSP and PCM), support for IDSP in Harvest Moon, fixed ADX checking bug

0.16 - 1/8/05 - YMF support added (works on most files, which are DSP-based)
                option to play single channel from ADX (which may have > 2 channels)
                thread priority adjustment
                loop points now reported in time instead of file offset
                optional delay before fade
                ISH/ISD looping fixed

0.15 - 12/30/05 - ISH/ISD support added, though looping is a weird hack

0.14 - 12/22/05 - ADX decoder volume reduction (to prevent clipping in Silent Hill ADXs) now optional (disabled by default)
                  stereo header detection now a little looser (fixes an IDSP)
                  dual-file stereo detected for files ending with "right" and "left"
                  support for Disney's Magical Mirror nonstandard loop

0.13 - 12/19/05 - files with equal loop points will be treated as nonlooping, slightly improved ADX decoder (less clipping)

0.12 - 12/16/05 - fixed IDSP (interleave now read from header), added support for Monopoly Party (files must be renamed .MPDSP)

0.11 - 12/11/05 - fixed ADX failure on files < 4K, support for ADX header 0x20 bytes into file (Sonic Mega Collection)

0.10 - 12/10/05 - better spt support: looping where supported, won't attempt to play multi-stream archives

0.9 - 12/8/05 - won't attempt to play files with obviously bad samplerates (<=0, >96000), fixed looping in tsutaBGM.dsp (Donkey Konga)

0.8 - 12/8/05 - fixed stupid bug from 0.7, ADXs only played in mono

0.7 - 12/6/05 - fixed bug where some short ADXs fail to play

0.6 - 12/5/05 - minor looping issue in noninterleaved DSPs fixed

0.5 - 12/3/05 - fixed bug with spd/spt. Support for Bomberman Jetters, which might break others...

0.4 - 12/3/05 - fixed bug introduced between in_dsp 1.9 and in_cube 0.0 which broke Metroid Prime 2 looping, clarified credits

0.3 - 12/2/05 - added MSS support, stereo playback for Wario World's dual-file stereo (files ending in _0.dsp and _1.dsp)

0.2 - 12/1/05 - new devkit-accurate ADP decoder by hcs, better ADP check (won't catch anything but ADP files, even with .ADP extension),
                cleaned up code (fixed compiler warnings, comments)

0.1 - 12/1/05 - ADPs play back at 48KHz (which the DTK spec states is standard)

0.0 - 11/30/05 - first release: incorporates in_adx loop mod v4, in_dsp version 1.10, and Cube2wav into in_dsp interface
