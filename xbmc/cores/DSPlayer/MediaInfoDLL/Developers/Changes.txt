I changed some elements in the interface.
No break in binary compatibily (no crash), but some details.


0.7.18 --> 0.7.19
-----------------
- XML output: track names are changed, for a better usability by XML parsers (<track type="x" streamid="x">)

0.7.12 --> 0.7.13
-----------------
- Chapters has now language type per item, another string format, and moved to the menu part
  Old string format was "Chapter number             : Time - chapter string"
  New string format is  "Time                       : chapter string / Optional info / Optional info" (optional info is separated by " / ")
  Note: if the language of the string is available, the string has the form "en:chapter string" (ISO-639 2-letter if available, else 3-letter)
  Note: if there is multiple languages, they are separated by " - "
        example of complex string: "Time                       : en:English - fr:Francais / en:More info - fr:plus d'infos"
  Note: for MPEG-TS EPG (Electronic program), string has this optional info (and Date/Time instead of time only):
        "UTC YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS          : Name / Description / Content type / Classification / Duration / Running status"
  For third-party software, Chapters_Pos_Begin and Chapters_Pos_End fields are include for informing about the field positions of chapters

0.7.8 --> 0.7.9
---------------
- Windows DLL C++ namespace has changed from MediaInfoLib to MediaInfoDLL

0.7.6.4 --> 0.7.7.0
-------------------
- (General) BitRate is replaced by OveralBitRate (Overal bitrate for ALL streams) (General BitRate field is DEPRECATED)
- PlayTime is replaced by Duration (PlayTime field is DEPRECATED)
- Codec is replaced by 2 fields:
 - Format is the real format string (ie "MPEG-4 Visual")
 - CodecID is the codec string filled in the container (ie "DX50")
 - CodecID/Hint is a hint for it (ie "DivX 5")
 (Codec fields are DEPRECATED)
- Interlacement field is replaced by 2 fields:
 - ScanType for "Progressive" or "Interlaced"
 - ScanOrder for "TFF" or "BFF"
 (Interlacement field is DEPRECATED)
- Chroma is replaced by Colorimetry (Chroma field is DEPRECATED)
- Video0_Delay is replaced by Video_Delay (I will try to calculate it from the corresponding video when multiple streams) (Video0_Delay0 field is DEPRECATED)
- Format_Settings_PacketBitStream is replaced by Format_Settings_MuxingMode set to "Packet Bitstream" (Format_Settings_PacketBitStream  field is DEPRECATED)

0.7.5.3 --> 0.7.5.4
-------------------
- (Video) AspectRatio --> DisplayAspectRatio (AspectRatio tag is DEPRECATED)
- (Video) PixelAspectRatio added
- AAC #defines has been splitted in ADTS and ADIF

0.7.2.1 --> 0.7.2.2
-------------------
- (General) OveralBitRate --> BitRate
- Visual --> Video (yes, I come back to the old style, Image streams are back, merging video and image was not a good idea)
- Bits/(Pixel*Frame) --> Bits-(Pixel*Frame)  (I need the special character "/" elsewhere...)

0.7.0.x --> 0.7.2.1
-------------------
- MediaInfo_Stream_Video --> MediaInfo_Stream_Visual
  (conformance with MPEG consortium names, Visual = Video or Image)
  Note: this is only if you use named options, the number is always "1",
  old programs will not have problems with this.
- To detect if this is a video or an image, you can test "Animated".
  Is 1 if this is a video, 0 if this is an Image
- MediaInfo_FileOption_Close --> MediaInfo_FileOption_CloseAll
  Note: better name only, the number is always 2
  old programs will not have problems with this.
- Values of MediaInfo_FileOption_* are precised
  (because these are binary flags)
  Note: precision only, numbers are always same
  old programs will not have problems with this.

0.6.x.x --> 0.7.0.x
-------------------
- Inform() : Option_Custom is deprecated
  - if "Inform" option is set, it is used. Unset it to have a "normal" view.
  - To have a HTML output, use Option("Inform", "HTML") before.
  I will change the documentation as soon as possible
- Tags : Somes tags have changed :
  - "Channels" is now "Channel(s)"
  - "Track" is now "Track/Position". Be warned : "Track" is used, but for other things
  - "Title" is now a generic name for 2 different names :
    - "Movie" for a movie (video and audio) name
    - "Track" for a track (audio only) name
    "Title" will always exist, you can continue to use it for a generic access
  - "XXX_String" are now "XXX/String"
