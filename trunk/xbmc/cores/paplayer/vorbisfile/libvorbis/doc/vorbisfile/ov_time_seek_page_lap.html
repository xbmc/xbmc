<h1>ov_time_seek_page_lap</h1>

<p><i>declared in "vorbis/vorbisfile.h";</i></p>

<p>For seekable streams, ov_time_seek_page_lap seeks to the closest
full page preceeding the given time.  This variant of <a
href="ov_time_seek_page.html">ov_time_seek_page</a> also automatically
crosslaps the transition from the previous playback position into the
new playback position in order to eliminate clicking and boundary
discontinuities.  Otherwise, usage and behavior is identical to <a
href="ov_time_seek_page.html">ov_time_seek_page</a>.

<p>ov_time_seek_page_lap is faster than <a
href="ov_time_seek_lap.html">ov_time_seek_lap</a> because it doesn't
seek through the last few samples to reach an exact time, but it is
also less accurate.  This should be used when speed is important, but
crosslapping is still desired.

<p>ov_time_seek_page_lap also updates everything needed within the
decoder, so you can immediately call <a
href="ov_read.html">ov_read()</a> and get data from the newly seeked
to position.

<p>ov_time_seek_page_lap will lap between logical stream links of
differing numbers of channels. Any extra channels from the origin of
the seek are ignored; playback of these channels simply ends. Extra
channels at the destination are lapped from silence.
ov_time_seek_page_lap will also lap between logical stream links of
differing sample rates.  In this case, the sample rates are ignored
(no implicit resampling is done to match playback). It is up to the
application developer to decide if this behavior makes any sense in a
given context; in practical use, these default behaviors perform
sensibly.

<p>This function does not work for unseekable streams.

<h3>Parameters</h3>
<dl>
<dt><i>vf</i></dt>
<dd>Pointer to our already opened and initialized OggVorbis_File structure.</dd>
<dt><i>ms</i></dt>
<dd>Location to seek to within the file, specified in seconds.</dd>
</dl>


<h3>Return Values</h3>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>0 for success</li>

<li>
nonzero indicates failure, described by several error codes:
  <ul>
  <li>OV_ENOSEEK - Bitstream is not seekable.
  </li>
  <li>OV_EINVAL - Invalid argument value; possibly called with an OggVorbis_File structure that isn't open.
  </li>
  <li>OV_EREAD - A read from media returned an error.
  </li>
  <li>OV_EFAULT - Internal logic fault; indicates a bug or heap/stack 
		corruption.
  </li>
  <li>OV_EOF - Indicates stream is at end of file immediately after a seek 
  (making crosslap impossible as there's no preceeding decode state to crosslap).
  </li>
  <li>OV_EBADLINK - Invalid stream section supplied to libvorbisfile, or the requested link is corrupt. 
  </li>
  </ul></li>
</ul></blockquote>
