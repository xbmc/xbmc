Tell me
=======
Nosefart is an NSF plug-in for Winamp.  That means it is a plug-in
for Winamp which plays NSF files.

NSFs are files which contain the music code and data from NES games.
All that you need to accurately play the music tracks back are 
accurate 6502 and NES sound register emulation.

You can always get the latest version of Nosefart at:

	http://www.nofrendo.org

Winamp lives here:

You can find a pornographic amount of NSFs at:

Things you may need
===================
- Working copy of Winamp
- Some NSFs


Make it go
==========
PIMP installer installs program files in the right places.

Getting an NSF file to run requires two steps:

1. Load up an NSF file with Winamp. 
2. Press the play button.

That's it.
