Code in this directory was modified by Paolo Bonzini <bonzini@gnu.org> starting
from libmikmod 3.1.8

libmikmod was cleaned up, removing code that was needed by libmikmod's
portability (MD_) layer and data that were needed by the player.  The player
itself now forms the core of TiMidity++'s mod.c file but is detached from
libunimod which is nothing more a generic module->UNI converter.  In addition,
libmikmod's own portable file I/O routines were changed to rely on libarc's
URL objects.

The code should be compatible enough that new libmikmod loaders should be
plugged in without even touching the code (only mloader.c's final part).
Some might require changing MREADER * to URL (e.g. amf, it).

libmikmod main authors
