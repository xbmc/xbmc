dnl
dnl This macro figures out how to build C programs using POSIX threads.
dnl It sets the PTHREAD_LIBS output variable to the threads library and
dnl linker flags, and the PTHREAD_CFLAGS output variable to any special
dnl C compiler flags that are needed. (The user can also force certain
dnl compiler flags/libs to be tested by setting these environment
dnl variables.)
dnl
dnl Also sets PTHREAD_CC to any special C compiler that is needed for
dnl multi-threaded programs (defaults to the value of CC otherwise).
dnl (This is necessary on AIX to use the special cc_r compiler alias.)
dnl
dnl NOTE: You are assumed to not only compile your program with these
dnl flags, but also link it with them as well. e.g. you should link
dnl with $PTHREAD_CC $CFLAGS $PTHREAD_CFLAGS $LDFLAGS ... $PTHREAD_LIBS
dnl $LIBS
dnl
dnl If you are only building threads programs, you may wish to use
dnl these variables in your default LIBS, CFLAGS, and CC:
dnl
dnl        LIBS="$PTHREAD_LIBS $LIBS"
dnl        CFLAGS="$CFLAGS $PTHREAD_CFLAGS"
dnl        CC="$PTHREAD_CC"
dnl
dnl In addition, if the PTHREAD_CREATE_JOINABLE thread-attribute
dnl constant has a nonstandard name, defines PTHREAD_CREATE_JOINABLE to
dnl that name (e.g. PTHREAD_CREATE_UNDETACHED on AIX).
dnl
dnl ACTION-IF-FOUND is a list of shell commands to run if a threads
dnl library is found, and ACTION-IF-NOT-FOUND is a list of commands to
dnl run it if it is not found. If ACTION-IF-FOUND is not specified, the
dnl default action will define HAVE_PTHREAD.
dnl
dnl Please let the authors know if this macro fails on any platform, or
dnl if you have any other suggestions or comments. This macro was based
dnl on work by SGJ on autoconf scripts for FFTW (www.fftw.org) (with
dnl help from M. Frigo), as well as ac_pthread and hb_pthread macros
dnl posted by Alejandro Forero Cuervo to the autoconf macro repository.
dnl We are also grateful for the helpful feedback of numerous users.

# C compiler flags, and other items are library names, except for "none"
# which indicates that we try without any flags at all, and "pthread-config"
# which is a program returning the flags for the Pth emulation library.

# The ordering *is* (sometimes) important.  Some notes on the

# pthreads: AIX (must check this before -lpthread)
# none: in case threads are in libc; should be tried before -Kthread and
#       other compiler flags to prevent continual compiler warnings
# -Kthread: Sequent (threads in libc, but -Kthread needed for pthread.h)
# -kthread: FreeBSD kernel threads (preferred to -pthread since SMP-able)
# lthread: LinuxThreads port on FreeBSD (also preferred to -pthread)
# -pthread: Linux/gcc (kernel threads), BSD/gcc (userland threads)
# -pthreads: Solaris/gcc
# -mthreads: Mingw32/gcc, Lynx/gcc
# -mt: Sun Workshop C (may only link SunOS threads [-lthread], but it
#      doesn't hurt to check since this sometimes defines pthreads too;
#      also defines -D_REENTRANT)
#      ... -mt is also the pthreads flag for HP/aCC
# pthread: Linux, etcetera
# --thread-safe: KAI C++
# pthread-config: use pthread-config program (for GNU Pth library)
