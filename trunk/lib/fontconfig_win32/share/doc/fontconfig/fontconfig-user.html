><H2
>Functional Overview</H2
><P
>Fontconfig contains two essential modules, the configuration module which
builds an internal configuration from XML files and the matching module
which accepts font patterns and returns the nearest matching font.
  </P
><DIV
CLASS="REFSECT2"
><A
NAME="AEN16"
></A
><H3
>Font Configuration</H3
><P
>The configuration module consists of the FcConfig datatype, libexpat and
FcConfigParse which walks over an XML tree and amends a configuration with
data found within.  From an external perspective, configuration of the
library consists of generating a valid XML tree and feeding that to
FcConfigParse.  The only other mechanism provided to applications for
changing the running configuration is to add fonts and directories to the
list of application-provided font files.  
    </P
><P
>The intent is to make font configurations relatively static, and shared by
as many applications as possible.  It is hoped that this will lead to more
stable font selection when passing names from one application to another.
XML was chosen as a configuration file format because it provides a format
which is easy for external agents to edit while retaining the correct
structure and syntax.
    </P
><P
>Font configuration is separate from font matching; applications needing to
do their own matching can access the available fonts from the library and
perform private matching.  The intent is to permit applications to pick and
choose appropriate functionality from the library instead of forcing them to
choose between this library and a private configuration mechanism.  The hope
is that this will ensure that configuration of fonts for all applications
can be centralized in one place.  Centralizing font configuration will
simplify and regularize font installation and customization.

>Font Properties</H3

>While font patterns may contain essentially any properties, there are some
well known properties with associated types.  Fontconfig uses some of these
properties for font matching and font completion.  Others are provided as a
convenience for the applications' rendering mechanism.

>Font Matching</H3
><P
>Fontconfig performs matching by measuring the distance from a provided
pattern to all of the available fonts in the system.  The closest matching
font is selected.  This ensures that a font will always be returned, but
doesn't ensure that it is anything like the requested pattern.
    </P
><P
> 
Font matching starts with an application constructed pattern.  The desired
attributes of the resulting font are collected together in a pattern.  Each
property of the pattern can contain one or more values; these are listed in
priority order; matches earlier in the list are considered "closer" than
matches later in the list.
    </P
><P
>The initial pattern is modified by applying the list of editing instructions
specific to patterns found in the configuration; each consists of a match
predicate and a set of editing operations.  They are executed in the order
they appeared in the configuration.  Each match causes the associated
sequence of editing operations to be applied.
    </P
><P
>After the pattern has been edited, a sequence of default substitutions are
performed to canonicalize the set of available properties; this avoids the
need for the lower layers to constantly provide default values for various
font properties during rendering.
    </P
><P
>The canonical font pattern is finally matched against all available fonts.
The distance from the pattern to the font is measured for each of several
properties: foundry, charset, family, lang, spacing, pixelsize, style,
slant, weight, antialias, rasterizer and outline.  This list is in priority
order -- results of comparing earlier elements of this list weigh more
heavily than later elements.
    </P
><P
>There is one special case to this rule; family names are split into two
bindings; strong and weak.  Strong family names are given greater precedence
in the match than lang elements while weak family names are given lower
precedence than lang elements.  This permits the document language to drive
font selection when any document specified font is unavailable.
    </P
><P
>The pattern representing that font is augmented to include any properties
found in the pattern but not found in the font itself; this permits the
application to pass rendering instructions or any other data through the
matching system.  Finally, the list of editing instructions specific to
fonts found in the configuration are applied to the pattern.  This modified
pattern is returned to the application.
    </P
><P
>The return value contains sufficient information to locate and rasterize the
font, including the file name, pixel size and other rendering data.  As
none of the information involved pertains to the FreeType library,
applications are free to use any rasterization engine or even to take
the identified font file and access it directly.
    </P
><P
>The match/edit sequences in the configuration are performed in two passes
because there are essentially two different operations necessary -- the
first is to modify how fonts are selected; aliasing families and adding
suitable defaults.  The second is to modify how the selected fonts are
rasterized.  Those must apply to the selected font, not the original pattern
as false matches will often occur.

141 of the languages with two-letter codes from ISO 639-2 and another 30
languages with only three-letter codes.  Languages with both two and three
letter codes are provided with only the two letter code.

elements hold either true or false.  An important limitation exists in
the parsing of floating point numbers -- fontconfig requires that
the mantissa start with a digit, not a decimal point, so insert a leading
zero for purely fractional values (e.g. use 0.5 instead of .5 and -0.5
instead of -.5).
