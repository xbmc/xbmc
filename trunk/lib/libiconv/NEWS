New in 1.13:
* The library and the iconv program now understand platform dependent aliases,
  for better compatibility with the platform's own iconv_open function.
  Examples: "646" on Solaris, "iso88591" on HP-UX, "IBM-1252" on AIX.
* For stateful encodings, when the input ends with a shift sequence followed
  by invalid input, the iconv function now increments the input pointer past
  the shift sequence before returning (size_t)(-1) with errno = EILSEQ. This
  is also like GNU libc's iconv() behaves.
* The library exports a new function iconv_open_into() that stores the
  conversion descriptor in pre-allocated memory, rather than allocating fresh
  memory for it.
* Added CP1131 converter.

New in 1.12:
* The iconv program is now licensed under the GPL version 3, instead of the
  GPL version 2. The libiconv library continues to be licensed under LGPL.
* Added RK1048 converter.
* On AIX, an existing system libiconv no longer causes setlocale() to fail.
* Upgraded EUC-KR, JOHAB to include the Korean postal code sign.

New in 1.11:
* The iconv program has new options --unicode-subst, --byte-subst,
  --widechar-subst that allow to specify substitutions for characters that
  cannot be converted.
* The iconv program now understands long options:
    long option    equivalent to
    --from-code    -f
    --to-code      -t
    --list         -l
    --silent       -s
* The CP936 converter is now different from the GBK converter: it has changed
  to include the Euro sign and private area characters. CP936 is no longer an
  alias of GBK.
* Updated GB18030 converter to include all private area characters.
* Updated CP950 converter to include the Euro sign and private area characters.
* Updated CP949 converter to include private area characters.

  BIG5-HKSCS:1999 and updated to Unicode 4. New converters BIG5-HKSCS:2001 and
  BIG5-HKSCS:2004 are added. BIG5-HKSCS is now an alias for BIG5-HKSCS:2004.
* Added a few irreversible mappings to the CP932 converter.
* Tidy up the list of symbols exported from libiconv (assumes gcc >= 4.0).
