KODI ADDON DEPENDENCIES
=======================
This directory contains the cmake-based buildsystem for addon dependencies. It
looks into the "common" and the "<platform>/cmake" sub-directories and parses
all *.txt files recursively. Each dependency must have its own <dependency>.txt
file (either in the main sub-directory or in a separate subdirectory of the main
subdirectory) which must follow one of the defined formats:
  * an empty file means that no extra downloads are necessary
  * <dependency>
  * <dependency> <url>
  * <dependency> <git-url> <git-revision>
where
  * <dependency> must be identical to the filename
  * <url> must be the URL to an archive that is downloaded and extracted.
  * <git-url> must be the URL of the git repository containing the
    dependency.
  * <git-revision> must be a valid git tag/branch/commit in the dependency's git
    repository which will be used for the build.

Reserved filenames (for additional information on how to build a dependency)
are:
  * CMakeLists.txt: build instructions for the dependency
  * install.txt: instructions on how to install the dependency's built files
  * noinstall.txt: no installation step required (content is ignored)
  * flags.txt: additional build flags
  * flags-<CPU>.txt: additional arch specific platform build flags
  * deps.txt: whitespace separated list of dependencies of this dependency

The buildsystem uses the following depends-related variables (which can be passed
into it when executing cmake with the -D<variable-name>=<value> option) to e.g.
access specific paths:
  * DEPENDS_TO_BUILD is a quoted, space delimited list of <dependency>s that
    you want to build (default is "all").
  * ADDON_EXTRA_ARGS is a quoted, space delimited list of arguments passed to
    all <dependency>s built (eg -DADDON_EXTRA_ARGS="-Darg1=1 -Darg2=2").
