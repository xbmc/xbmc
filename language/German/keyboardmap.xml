<!-- This configuration file was developed to be able to map an english layout keyboard to a german layout keyboard in XBMC.
    The problem: if I press the key that is labeled with "Z" on my german keyboard (next to the key labeled with "T" -> QWERTZ!) 
    I get an "Y" on my XBMC screen because till now XBMC always assumes an english layout keyboard (QWERTY). 
    If I press the "," on the numpad i get a ".". 
    This applies for nearly all keys on my german keyboard besides "A"-"Z" and "0"-"9".
    With the following mapping I can configure XBMC to replace the "Y" through an "Z" and so forth!
        
    This demands a map for printable characters (ascii and/or unicode) and logical keys (virtual keys or other names).
    The map for printable characters and the map for logical keys must be separated 
    since they can contain same values that should be mapped different.
    
    Of course, you should never reassign the same printable character 
    without (or with the same) modifiers more than once.
    
    More specific mappings, i.e. with virtual keys and/or with one or even more modifiers,
    are handled first/prioritized over less specific mappings! Why?
    Example: an us keyboard has: "]" on one key, the german keyboard has "+" on the same key,
    additionally the german keyboard has "~" on the same key, but the "~" 
    can only be reached with the special modifier "AltGr" (right alt).
    If "+" is handled first, the key is already consumed and "~" can never be reached.
    The least specific mappings, e.g. "regardless modifiers" are done at last/least prioritized.
    
    I assume that once a configuration is "complete", it is useful for everybody with that language, platform or model.    
    So let's start configuring keyboards for xbmc, collect and exchange them :o).
    
    We should collect them all in a structure like:
    * XBMCdefault 
      * standardkeyboard (this could be the standard language folder in the XBMC)
        * english
        * german
        * ...
    If needed, additionally:
    * producer (this could be the root folder on some server for exchange)
      * keyboard model
        * language a
        * language b
