About Win32++
-------------
Win32++ is simple and easy to understand framework for developing Win32 
applications using C++. It brings an object oriented approach to programming 
directly with the Win32 API. Each window created is a C++ class object capable 
of having its own window procedure for routing messages.

Win32++ supports the following compilers and development environments:
* Borland C++ Compiler 5.5
* Borland Developer Studio 2006
* Dev-C++
* Microsoft Visual C++ Toolkit 2003
* Microsoft Visual C++ 2005 Express Edition
* Microsoft Visual C++ 2008 Express Edition
* Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 Express Edition
* Microsoft Visual Studio 6.0
* Microsoft Visual Studio.net 2003
* Microsoft Visual Studio.net 2005
* Microsoft Visual Studio.net 2008
* Microsoft Visual Studio.net 2010
* MinGW compiler

Win32++ supports the following operating systems
* Windows 95
* Windows 98
* Windows ME
* Windows NT 4
* Windows 2000
* Windows XP 	(32bit and 64bit)
* Windows 2003 Server (32bit and 64bit)
* Windows Vista	(32bit and 64bit)
* Windows 2008 Server (32bit and 64bit)
* Windows 7 (32 bit and 64 bit)
* Windows CE from WCE400 (Windows mobile 2003) to WCE600 (Windows mobile 6)

Getting Started
---------------
Each file download includes the project files for Dev-C++, CodeBlocks and the
various compilers from Microsoft. CodeBlocks is an IDE (Integrated Development
Environment) that supports GNU GCC, Borland Developer Studio 2006 and Microsoft
C++ Toolkit 2003.

You  can start with one of the sample programs, and add your code. Alternatively
you can start with the projects and sample code provided in the "new projects" 
folder. 

For additional information on getting started, refer to the help included
in the documentation.
