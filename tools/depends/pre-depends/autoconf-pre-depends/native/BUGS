and use with caution an Autoconf with ``Important bugs''.

* Status

                 /*------------------------------------.
                 | New features need further testing.  |

* Now that configure depends on shell functions, it is possible that
  configure scripts may fail to run on old platforms that lack a shell
  with proper function support.

* Autotest parallel testsuite support is still a work in progress.
  There are known issues in job handling under dash and some ksh
  variants, where a parallel testsuite can hang or cause a 100%
  processor load.  In the current release, the overall autoconf
  testsuite only exercises parallel autotest under bash and zsh, or if
  you have defined TEST_PARALLEL_AUTOTEST in the environment.
  Meanwhile, Cygwin has known problems with named fifos that cause
  failures when attempting parallel tests in an autotest suite.  It is
  possible that other difficulties will be encountered, whether with
  shell or platform limitations; help is appreciated in improving
  parallel testsuite support.
