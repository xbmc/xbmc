Notes on status of CoreAudio Implementation of PortAudio

Document Last Updated December 9, 2005

There are currently two implementations of PortAudio for Mac Core Audio.

The original is in pa_mac_core_old.c, and the newer, default implementation
is in pa_mac_core.c.
Only pa_mac_core.c is currently developed and supported as it uses apple's
current core audio technology. To select use the old implementation, replace
pa_mac_core.c with pa_mac_core_old.c (eg. "cp pa_mac_core_auhal.c
pa_mac_core.c"), then run configure and make as usual.

Notes on Newer/Default AUHAL implementation:

by Bjorn Roche

Last Updated December 9, 2005

Principle of Operation:

This implementation uses AUHAL for audio I/O. To some extent, it also
operates at the "HAL" Layer, though this behavior can be limited by
platform specific flags (see pa_mac_core.h for details). The default
settings should be reasonable: they don't change the SR of the device and
don't cause interruptions if other devices are using the device.

Major Software Elements Used: Apple's HAL AUs provide output SR
conversion transparently, however, only on output, so this
implementation uses AudioConverters to convert the sample rate on input.
A PortAudio ring buffer is used to buffer input when sample rate
conversion is required or when separate audio units are used for duplex
IO. Finally, a PortAudio buffer processor is used to convert formats and
provide additional buffers if needed. Internally, interleaved floating
point data streams are used exclusively - the audio unit converts from
the audio hardware's native format to interleaved float PCM and
PortAudio's Buffer processor is used for conversion to user formats.

Simplex Input: Simplex input uses a single callback. If sample rate
conversion is required, a ring buffer and AudioConverter are used as
well.

Simplex output: Simplex output uses a single callback. No ring buffer or
audio converter is used because AUHAL does its own output SR conversion.

Duplex, one device (no SR conversion): When one device is used, a single
callback is used. This achieves very low latency.

Duplex, separate devices or SR conversion: When SR conversion is
required, data must be buffered before it is converted and data is not
always available at the same times on input and output, so SR conversion
requires the same treatment as separate devices. The input callback
reads data and puts it in the ring buffer. The output callback reads the
data off the ring buffer, into an audio converter and finally to the
buffer processor.

Platform Specific Options:

By using the flags in pa_mac_core.h, the user may specify several options.
For example, the user can specify the sample-rate conversion quality, and
the extent to which PA will attempt to "play nice" and to what extent it
will interrupt other apps to improve performance. For example, if 44100 Hz
sample rate is requested but the device is set at 48000 Hz, PA can either
change the device for optimal playback ("Pro" mode), which may interrupt
other programs playing back audio, or simple use a sample-rate coversion,
which allows for friendlier sharing of the device ("Play Nice" mode).

Additionally, the user may define a "channel mapping" by calling
paSetupMacCoreChannelMap() on their stream info structure before opening
the stream with it. See below for creating a channel map.

Known issues:

- Buffering: No buffering beyond that provided by core audio is provided
except where absolutely needed for the implementation to work. This may cause
issues with large framesPerBuffer settings and it also means that no additional
latency will be provided even if a large latency setting is selected.

- Latency: Latency settings are generally ignored. They may be used as a
hint for buffer size in paHostFramesPerBufferUnspecified, or the value may
be used in cases where additional buffering is needed, such as doing input and
output on seperate devices. Latency settings are always automatically bound
to "safe" values, however, so setting extreme values here should not be
an issue.

- Buffer Size: paHostFramesPerBufferUnspecified and specific host buffer sizes
are supported. paHostFramesPerBufferUnspecified works best in "pro" mode,
where the buffer size and sample rate of the audio device is most likely
to match the expected values. In the case of paHostFramesPerBuffer, an
appropriate framesPerBuffer value will be used that guarantees minimum
requested latency if that's possible.

- Timing info. It reports on stream time, but I'm probably doing something
wrong since patest_sine_time often reports negative latency numbers. Also,
there are currently issues with some devices whehn plugging/unplugging
devices.

- xrun detection: The only xrun detection performed is when reading
and writing the ring buffer. There is probably more that can be done.

- abort/stop issues: stopping a stream is always a complete operation,
but latency should be low enough to make the lack of a separate abort
unnecessary. Apple clarifies its AudioOutputUnitStop() call here:
http://lists.apple.com/archives/coreaudio-api/2005/Dec/msg00055.html

- blocking interface: should work fine.

- multichannel: It has been tested successfully on multichannel hardware
from MOTU: traveler and 896HD. Also Presonus firepod and others. It is
believed to work with all Core Audio devices, including virtual devices
such as soundflower.

- sample rate conversion quality: By default, SR conversion is the maximum
available. This can be tweaked using flags pa_mac_core.h. Note that the AU
render quyality property is used to set the sample rate conversion quality
as "documented" here:
http://lists.apple.com/archives/coreaudio-api/2004/Jan/msg00141.html

- x86/Universal Binary: Universal binaries can be build.



Creating a channel map:

How to create the map array -  Text taken From AUHAL.rtfd :
[3] Channel Maps
Clients can tell the AUHAL units which channels of the device they are interested in.  For example, the client may be processing stereo data, but outputting to a six-channel device.  This is done by using the kAudioOutputUnitProperty_ChannelMap property.  To use this property:

For Output:
Create an array of SInt32 that is the size of the number of channels of the device (Get the Format of the AUHAL's output Element == 0)
Initialize each of the array's values to -1 (-1 indicates that that channel is NOT to be presented in the conversion.)

Next, for each channel of your app's output, set:
channelMapArray[deviceOutputChannel] = desiredAppOutputChannel.

For example: we have a 6 channel output device and our application has a stereo source it wants to provide to the device.  Suppose we want that stereo source to go to the 3rd and 4th channels of the device. The channel map would look like this: { -1, -1, 0, 1, -1, -1 }

Where the formats are:
Input Element == 0: 2 channels (- client format - settable)
Output Element == 0: 6 channels (- device format - NOT settable)

So channel 2 (zero-based) of the device will take the first channel of output and channel 3 will take the second channel of output. (This translates to the 3rd and 4th plugs of the 6 output plugs of the device of course!)

For Input:
Create an array of SInt32 that is the size of the number of channels of the format you require for input.  Get (or Set in this case as needed) the AUHAL's output Element == 1.

Next, for each channel of input you require, set:
channelMapArray[desiredAppInputChannel] = deviceOutputChannel;

For example: we have a 6 channel input device from which we wish to receive stereo input from the 3rd and 4th channels. The channel map looks like this: { 2, 3 }

Where the formats are:
Input Element == 0: 2 channels (- device format - NOT settable)
Output Element == 0: 6 channels (- client format - settable)

Notes on Original implementation:

WHAT WORKS

Output with very low latency, <10 msec.
Half duplex input or output.
Full duplex on the same CoreAudio device.
The paFLoat32, paInt16, paInt8, paUInt8 sample formats.
Pa_GetCPULoad()
Pa_StreamTime()

KNOWN BUGS OR LIMITATIONS

We do not yet support simultaneous input and output on different 
devices. Note that some CoreAudio devices like the Roland UH30 look 
like one device but are actually two different CoreAudio devices. The 
Built-In audio is typically one CoreAudio device.

Mono doesn't work.

DEVICE MAPPING

CoreAudio devices can support both input and output. But the sample 
rates supported may be different. So we have map one or two PortAudio 
device to each CoreAudio device depending on whether it supports 
input, output or both.

When we query devices, we first get a list of CoreAudio devices. Then 
we scan the list and add a PortAudio device for each CoreAudio device 
that supports input. Then we make a scan for output devices.
