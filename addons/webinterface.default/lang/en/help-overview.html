<h2 id="what-is-chorus-">What is Chorus?</h2>
<p>Chorus is a web interface for controlling and interacting with <a href="http://kodi.tv">Kodi</a>. It is hosted by your
Kodi installation so anything that can run Kodi should have no problems with Chorus.</p>
<p>With a web interface you could potentially be controlling a Kodi player from the other side of the world.
But more likely, you will be controlling a local Kodi player in your home or office.</p>
<h3 id="who-made-this-thing-">Who made this thing?</h3>
<p>Chorus was created by <a href="http://jez.me">Jeremy Graham</a>, a Kodi team member who has been obsessed with
Kodi since its original inception as Xbox Media Player many years ago. He has invested thousands of hours in
the pursuit of the perfect Kodi web interface, all of which has lead to what you are using right now.</p>
<p>To say thanks to Jeremy for making Kodi great to use via a browser or maybe just some encouragement to make it
even better? You can <a href="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_donations&amp;business=ZCGV976794JHE&amp;lc=AU&amp;item_name=Chorus%20Beer%20Fund&amp;currency_code=AUD&amp;bn=PP%2dDonationsBF%3abtn_donate_SM%2egif%3aNonHosted">buy him a beer or 2</a>.</p>
