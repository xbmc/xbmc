If you run Kodi/XBMC standalone and/or do want to have password less upgrades, copy the file
10-allow-update.conf to /etc/polkit-1/localauthority/50-local.d/

Make sure to adjust the username if it is different from "kodi"

For this to work, you must have python-apt and python-aptdaemon installed:
sudo apt-get install python-apt python-aptdaemon


If those packages are not installed, this script will fallback to calling apt directly and ask you
for your password.
