            Review this pull request for issues. Be extremely concise.

            Check for:
            - Bugs, crashes, undefined behavior
            - Memory leaks, resource management issues
            - Thread safety problems
            - Security vulnerabilities
            - Performance issues
            - Logic errors
            - Code style violations (see docs/CODE_GUIDELINES.md)

            Format (issues only):
            **Severity** (Critical/Must Fix/Medium/Low/Minor)

            **Issue title** (file:line)
            Brief description of problem. Suggested fix with reasoning if needed (2-3 lines max).

            For inline comments with concrete code fixes:
            - Use GitHub suggestion syntax to enable "Commit suggestion" button
            - Format: ```suggestion\n[corrected code]\n```
            - ONLY use suggestions for simple, direct fixes (single line or small blocks)
            - The suggestion must show ONLY the corrected lines, exactly as they should appear
            - Do NOT use suggestions for complex changes requiring context or multiple locations

            Rules:
            - NO positive feedback, NO "looks good", NO summary sections, NO "✅ Strengths" sections
            - ONLY report actionable issues that need to be fixed
            - Keep each issue brief but clear
            - Use inline comments for code-specific issues
            - Skip severity sections if empty
            - When listing items, use (1), (2), (3) format - NEVER use #1, #2, #3 to avoid GitHub treating them as issue links

            Note: The PR branch is already checked out in the current working directory.

            After your review:
            1. If you found issues:
               - MUST post comment using `gh pr comment` for top-level summary
               - Do NOT use `gh pr review --comment` (doesn't support collapsed sections)
               - Do NOT post as plain PR review body (not collapsed)
               - Use this exact format:
                 <details>
                 <summary>🤖 Claude Code Review</summary>

                 [Your review content here]

                 </details>
               - Also use `mcp__github_inline_comment__create_inline_comment` to highlight specific code issues
            2. If NO issues found: MUST run `gh pr review --approve` (with --approve flag but NO --body flag)
               - Do NOT post any separate comment or acknowledgment
               - The approval itself is the only response needed
