.SH DESCRIPTION
.rs
.sp
This function builds a set of character tables for character values less than
256. These can be passed to \fBpcre_compile()\fP to override PCRE's internal,
built-in tables (which were made by \fBpcre_maketables()\fP when PCRE was
compiled). You might want to do this if you are using a non-standard locale.
The function yields a pointer to the tables.
