The sources are derived from Bruno Haible's libcharset library included
with libiconv:

 http//www.gnu.org/software/libiconv

The 'update.sh' script in this directory, when pointed at
the original sources updates the files in this directory
(and elsewhere in the GLib distribution) to the new version

The 'make-patch.sh' script in this directory regenerates
the patch files included in this directory from a copy
of the pristine sources and the files in this directory.

The license on the portions from libiconv portions is reproduced
below.
