C-Pluff, a plug-in framework for C
==================================

C-Pluff is a plug-in framework for C programs. It has been strongly inspired by
the Java plug-in framework in Eclipse. C-Pluff focuses on providing core
services for plug-in interaction and plug-in management. It aims to be platform
neutral and supports dynamic changes to plug-in configuration without stopping
the whole application or framework.

For more information, see the documentation at C-Pluff web site.
