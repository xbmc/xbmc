1 Introduction
**************

All symbols defined in the public API start with `MHD_'.  MHD is a
small HTTP daemon library.  As such, it does not have any API for
logging errors (you can only enable or disable logging to stderr).
Also, it may not support all of the HTTP features directly, where
applicable, portions of HTTP may have to be handled by clients of the
library.

   The library is supposed to handle everything that it must handle
(because the API would not allow clients to do this), such as basic
connection management; however, detailed interpretations of headers --
such as range requests -- and HTTP methods are left to clients.  The
library does understand `HEAD' and will only send the headers of the
response and not the body, even if the client supplied a body.  The
library also understands headers that control connection management
(specifically, `Connection: close' and `Expect: 100 continue' are
understood and handled automatically).

   MHD understands `POST' data and is able to decode certain formats
(at the moment only `application/x-www-form-urlencoded' and
`multipart/form-data') using the post processor API.  The data stream
of a POST is also provided directly to the main application, so
unsupported encodings could still be processed, just not conveniently
by MHD.

   The header file defines various constants used by the HTTP protocol.
This does not mean that MHD actually interprets all of these values.
The provided constants are exported as a convenience for users of the
library.  MHD does not verify that transmitted HTTP headers are part of
the standard specification; users of the library are free to define
their own extensions of the HTTP standard and use those with MHD.

   All functions are guaranteed to be completely reentrant and
thread-safe.  MHD checks for allocation failures and tries to recover
gracefully (for example, by closing the connection).  Additionally,
clients can specify resource limits on the overall number of
connections, number of connections per IP address and memory used per
connection to avoid resource exhaustion.

2 Constants
***********

 -- Enumeration: MHD_FLAG
     Options for the MHD daemon.

     Note that if neither `MHD_USER_THREAD_PER_CONNECTION' nor
     `MHD_USE_SELECT_INTERNALLY' are used, the client wants control over
     the process and will call the appropriate microhttpd callbacks.

     Starting the daemon may also fail if a particular option is not
     implemented or not supported on the target platform (i.e. no
     support for SSL, threads or IPv6).  SSL support generally depends
     on options given during MHD compilation.  Threaded operations
     (including `MHD_USE_SELECT_INTERNALLY') are not supported on
     Symbian.

    `MHD_NO_FLAG'
          No options selected.

    `MHD_USE_DEBUG'
          Run in debug mode.  If this flag is used, the library should
          print error messages and warnings to stderr.  Note that MHD
          also needs to be compiled with the configure option
          `--enable-messages' for this run-time option to have any
          effect.

    `MHD_USE_SSL'
          Run in https mode (this option may not work with all
          threading modes yet).

    `MHD_USE_THREAD_PER_CONNECTION'
          Run using one thread per connection.

    `MHD_USE_SELECT_INTERNALLY'
          Run using an internal thread doing `SELECT'.

    `MHD_USE_IPv6'
          Run using the IPv6 protocol (otherwise, MHD will just support
          IPv4).

    `MHD_USE_PEDANTIC_CHECKS'
          Be pedantic about the protocol (as opposed to as tolerant as
          possible).  Specifically, at the moment, this flag causes MHD
          to reject HTTP 1.1 connections without a `Host' header.  This
          is required by the standard, but of course in violation of
          the "be as liberal as possible in what you accept" norm.  It
          is recommended to turn this *ON* if you are testing clients
          against MHD, and *OFF* in production.

    `MHD_USE_POLL'
          Use poll instead of select. This allows sockets with
          descriptors `>= FD_SETSIZE'.  This option only works in
          conjunction with `MHD_USE_THREAD_PER_CONNECTION' (at this
          point).


 -- Enumeration: MHD_OPTION
     MHD options.  Passed in the varargs portion of
     `MHD_start_daemon()'.

    `MHD_OPTION_END'
          No more options / last option.  This is used to terminate the
          VARARGs list.

    `MHD_OPTION_CONNECTION_MEMORY_LIMIT'
          Maximum memory size per connection (followed by a `size_t').
          The default is 32 kB (32*1024 bytes) as defined by the
          internal constant `MHD_POOL_SIZE_DEFAULT'.

    `MHD_OPTION_CONNECTION_LIMIT'
          Maximum number of concurrenct connections to accept (followed
          by an `unsigned int').  The default is `FD_SETSIZE - 4' (the
          maximum number of file descriptors supported by `select' minus
          four for `stdin', `stdout', `stderr' and the server socket).
          In other words, the default is as large as possible.

    `MHD_OPTION_CONNECTION_TIMEOUT'
          After how many seconds of inactivity should a connection
          automatically be timed out? (followed by an `unsigned int';
          use zero for no timeout).  The default is zero (no timeout).

    `MHD_OPTION_NOTIFY_COMPLETED'
          Register a function that should be called whenever a request
          has been completed (this can be used for application-specific
          clean up).  Requests that have never been presented to the
          application (via `MHD_AccessHandlerCallback()') will not
          result in notifications.

          This option should be followed by *TWO* pointers.  First a
          pointer to a function of type `MHD_RequestCompletedCallback()'
          and second a pointer to a closure to pass to the request
          completed callback.  The second pointer maybe `NULL'.

    `MHD_OPTION_PER_IP_CONNECTION_LIMIT'
          Limit on the number of (concurrent) connections made to the
          server from the same IP address.  Can be used to prevent one
          IP from taking over all of the allowed connections.  If the
          same IP tries to establish more than the specified number of
          connections, they will be immediately rejected.  The option
          should be followed by an `unsigned int'.  The default is
          zero, which means no limit on the number of connections from
          the same IP address.

    `MHD_OPTION_SOCK_ADDR'
          Bind daemon to the supplied socket address. This option
          should be followed by a `struct sockaddr *'.  If
          `MHD_USE_IPv6' is specified, the `struct sockaddr*' should
          point to a `struct sockaddr_in6', otherwise to a `struct
          sockaddr_in'.  If this option is not specified, the daemon
          will listen to incomming connections from anywhere.

    `MHD_OPTION_URI_LOG_CALLBACK'
          Specify a function that should be called before parsing the
          URI from the client.  The specified callback function can be
          used for processing the URI (including the options) before it
          is parsed.  The URI after parsing will no longer contain the
          options, which maybe inconvenient for logging.  This option
          should be followed by two arguments, the first one must be of
          the form
                void * my_logger(void * cls, const char * uri)
          where the return value will be passed as `*con_cls' in calls
          to the `MHD_AccessHandlerCallback' when this request is
          processed later; returning a value of NULL has no special
          significance; (however, note that if you return non-NULL, you
          can no longer rely on the first call to the access handler
          having `NULL == *con_cls on entry' on entry) `cls' will be
          set to the second argument following
          MHD_OPTION_URI_LOG_CALLBACK.  Finally, `uri' will be the
          0-terminated URI of the request.

    `MHD_OPTION_HTTPS_MEM_KEY'
          Memory pointer to the private key to be used by the HTTPS
          daemon.  This option should be followed by an "const char*"
          argument.  This should be used in conjunction with
          'MHD_OPTION_HTTPS_MEM_CERT'.

    `MHD_OPTION_HTTPS_MEM_CERT'
          Memory pointer to the certificate to be used by the HTTPS
          daemon.  This option should be followed by an "const char*"
          argument.  This should be used in conjunction with
          'MHD_OPTION_HTTPS_MEM_KEY'.

    `MHD_OPTION_CRED_TYPE'
          Daemon credentials type.  Either certificate or anonymous,
          this option should be followed by one of the values listed in
          "enum MHD_GNUTLS_CredentialsType".

    `MHD_OPTION_PROTOCOL_VERSION'
          SSL/TLS protocol version.  Memory pointer to a zero
          (MHD_GNUTLS_PROTOCOL_END) terminated (const) array of 'enum
          MHD_GNUTLS_Protocol' values representing the protocol
          versions to this server should support. Unsupported requests
          will be dropped by the server.

    `MHD_OPTION_CIPHER_ALGORITHM'
          Memory pointer to a zero (MHD_GNUTLS_CIPHER_UNKNOWN)
          terminated (const) array of 'enum MHD_GNUTLS_CipherAlgorithm'
          representing the cipher priority order to which the HTTPS
          daemon should adhere.

    `MHD_OPTION_EXTERNAL_LOGGER'
          Use the given function for logging error messages.  This
          option must be followed by two arguments; the first must be a
          pointer to a function of type 'void fun(void * arg, const
          char * fmt, va_list ap)' and the second a pointer of type
          'void*' which will be passed as the "arg" argument to "fun".

          Note that MHD will not generate any log messages if it was
          compiled without the "-enable-messages" flag being set and
          the MHD_USE_DEBUG flag being set, even if this argument is
          used.

    `MHD_OPTION_ARRAY'
          This option can be used for initializing MHD using options
          from an array.  A common use for this is writing an FFI for
          MHD.  The actual options given are in an array of 'struct
          MHD_OptionItem', so this option requires a single argument of
          type 'struct MHD_OptionItem'.  The array must be terminated
          with an entry `MHD_OPTION_END'.

          An example for code using MHD_OPTION_ARRAY is:
               struct MHD_OptionItem ops[] = {
                { MHD_OPTION_CONNECTION_LIMIT, 100, NULL },
                { MHD_OPTION_CONNECTION_TIMEOUT, 10, NULL },
                { MHD_OPTION_END, 0, NULL }
               };
               d = MHD_start_daemon(0, 8080, NULL, NULL, dh, NULL,
                                    MHD_OPTION_ARRAY, ops,
                                    MHD_OPTION_END);
          For options that expect a single pointer argument, the second
          member of the `struct MHD_OptionItem' is ignored.  For
          options that expect two pointer arguments, the first argument
          must be cast to `intptr_t'.

 -- C Struct: MHD_OptionItem
     Entry in an MHD_OPTION_ARRAY.  See the `MHD_OPTION_ARRAY' option
     argument for its use.

     The `option' member is used to specify which option is specified
     in the array.  The other members specify the respective argument.

     Note that for options taking only a single pointer, the
     `ptr_value' member should be set.  For options taking two pointer
     arguments, the first pointer must be cast to `intptr_t' and both
     the `value' and the `ptr_value' members should be used to pass the
     two pointers.

 -- Enumeration: MHD_ValueKind
     The `MHD_ValueKind' specifies the source of the key-value pairs in
     the HTTP protocol.

    `MHD_RESPONSE_HEADER_KIND'
          Response header.

    `MHD_HEADER_KIND'
          HTTP header.

    `MHD_COOKIE_KIND'
          Cookies.  Note that the original HTTP header containing the
          cookie(s) will still be available and intact.

    `MHD_POSTDATA_KIND'
          `POST' data.  This is available only if a content encoding
          supported by MHD is used (currently only URL encoding), and
          only if the posted content fits within the available memory
          pool.  Note that in that case, the upload data given to the
          `MHD_AccessHandlerCallback()' will be empty (since it has
          already been processed).

    `MHD_GET_ARGUMENT_KIND'
          `GET' (URI) arguments.

    `MHD_HEADER_KIND'
          HTTP footer (only for http 1.1 chunked encodings).


 -- Enumeration: MHD_RequestTerminationCode
     The `MHD_RequestTerminationCode' specifies reasons why a request
     has been terminated (or completed).

    `MHD_REQUEST_TERMINATED_COMPLETED_OK'
          We finished sending the response.

    `MHD_REQUEST_TERMINATED_WITH_ERROR'
          Error handling the connection (resources exhausted, other
          side closed connection, application error accepting request,
          etc.)

    `MHD_REQUEST_TERMINATED_TIMEOUT_REACHED'
          No activity on the connection for the number of seconds
          specified using `MHD_OPTION_CONNECTION_TIMEOUT'.

    `MHD_REQUEST_TERMINATED_DAEMON_SHUTDOWN'
          We had to close the session since MHD was being shut down.

 -- Enumeration: MHD_GNUTLS_Protocol
     SSL/TLS Protocol types.  Note that not all listed algorithms are
     necessarily supported by all builds of MHD.

    `MHD_GNUTLS_PROTOCOL_END'

    `MHD_GNUTLS_PROTOCOL_SSL3'

    `MHD_GNUTLS_PROTOCOL_TLS1_0'

    `MHD_GNUTLS_PROTOCOL_TLS1_1'

    `MHD_GNUTLS_PROTOCOL_TLS1_2'

    `MHD_GNUTLS_PROTOCOL_UNKNOWN'

 -- Enumeration: MHD_GNUTLS_CipherAlgorithm
     List of symmetric ciphers.  Note that not all listed algorithms
     are necessarily supported by all builds of MHD.

    `MHD_GNUTLS_CIPHER_UNKNOWN'

    `MHD_GNUTLS_CIPHER_NULL'

    `MHD_GNUTLS_CIPHER_ARCFOUR_128'

    `MHD_GNUTLS_CIPHER_3DES_CBC'

    `MHD_GNUTLS_CIPHER_AES_128_CBC'

    `MHD_GNUTLS_CIPHER_AES_256_CBC'

 -- Enumeration: MHD_ConnectionInfoType
     Values of this enum are used to specify what information about a
     connection is desired.

    `MHD_CONNECTION_INFO_CIPHER_ALGO'
          What cipher algorithm is being used.  Takes no extra
          arguments.

    `MHD_CONNECTION_INFO_PROTOCOL,'
          Takes no extra arguments.


 -- Enumeration: MHD_DaemonInfoType
     Values of this enum are used to specify what information about a
     deamon is desired.
    `MHD_DAEMON_INFO_KEY_SIZE'
          Request information about the key size for a particular cipher
          algorithm.  The cipher algorithm should be passed as an extra
          argument (of type 'enum MHD_GNUTLS_CipherAlgorithm').

    `MHD_DAEMON_INFO_MAC_KEY_SIZE'
          Request information about the key size for a particular cipher
          algorithm.  The cipher algorithm should be passed as an extra
          argument (of type 'enum MHD_GNUTLS_HashAlgorithm').

    `MHD_DAEMON_INFO_LISTEN_FD'
          Request the file-descriptor number that MHD is using to
          listen to the server socket.  This can be useful if no port
          was specified and a client needs to learn what port is
          actually being used by MHD.  No extra arguments should be
          passed.

3 Structures type definition
****************************

 -- C Struct: MHD_Daemon
     Handle for the daemon (listening on a socket for HTTP traffic).

 -- C Struct: MHD_Connection
     Handle for a connection / HTTP request.  With HTTP/1.1, multiple
     requests can be run over the same connection.  However, MHD will
     only show one request per TCP connection to the client at any
     given time.

 -- C Struct: MHD_Response
     Handle for a response.

 -- C Struct: MHD_PostProcessor
     Handle for `POST' processing.

 -- C Union: MHD_ConnectionInfo
     Information about a connection.

 -- C Union: MHD_DaemonInfo
     Information about an MHD daemon.

4 Callback functions definition
*******************************

 -- Function Pointer: int *MHD_AcceptPolicyCallback (void *cls, const
          struct sockaddr * addr, socklen_t addrlen)
     Invoked in the context of a connection to allow or deny a client to
     connect.  This callback return `MHD_YES' if connection is allowed,
     `MHD_NO' if not.

    CLS
          custom value selected at callback registration time;

    ADDR
          address information from the client;

    ADDRLEN
          length of the address information.

 -- Function Pointer: int *MHD_AccessHandlerCallback (void *cls, struct
          MHD_Connection * connection, const char *url, const char
          *method, const char *version, const char *upload_data, size_t
          *upload_data_size, void **con_cls)
     Invoked in the context of a connection to answer a request from the
     client.  This callback must call MHD functions (example: the
     `MHD_Response' ones) to provide content to give back to the client
     and return an HTTP status code (i.e. `200' for OK, `404', etc.).

     *note microhttpd-post::, for details on how to code this callback.

     Must return `MHD_YES' if the connection was handled successfully,
     `MHD_NO' if the socket must be closed due to a serious error while
     handling the request

    CLS
          custom value selected at callback registration time;

    URL
          the URL requested by the client;

    METHOD
          the HTTP method used by the client (`GET', `PUT', `DELETE',
          `POST', etc.);

    VERSION
          the HTTP version string (i.e. `HTTP/1.1');

    UPLOAD_DATA
          the data being uploaded (excluding headers): 

             * for a `POST' that fits into memory and that is encoded
               with a supported encoding, the `POST' data will *NOT* be
               given in UPLOAD_DATA and is instead available as part of
               `MHD_get_connection_values()';

             * very large `POST' data *will* be made available
               incrementally in UPLOAD_DATA;

    UPLOAD_DATA_SIZE
          set initially to the size of the UPLOAD_DATA provided; this
          callback must update this value to the number of bytes *NOT*
          processed; unless external select is used, the callback maybe
          required to process at least some data.  If the callback
          fails to process data in multi-threaded or internal-select
          mode and if the read-buffer is already at the maximum size
          that MHD is willing to use for reading (about half of the
          maximum amount of memory allowed for the connection), then
          MHD will abort handling the connection and return an internal
          server error to the client.  In order to avoid this, clients
          must be able to process upload data incrementally and reduce
          the value of `upload_data_size'.

    CON_CLS
          reference to a pointer, initially set to `NULL', that this
          callback can set to some address and that will be preserved
          by MHD for future calls for this request;

          since the access handler may be called many times (i.e., for a
          `PUT'/`POST' operation with plenty of upload data) this allows
          the application to easily associate some request-specific
          state;

          if necessary, this state can be cleaned up in the global
          `MHD_RequestCompletedCallback' (which can be set with the
          `MHD_OPTION_NOTIFY_COMPLETED').

 -- Function Pointer: void *MHD_RequestCompletedCallback (void *cls,
          struct MHD_Connectionconnection, void **con_cls, enum
          MHD_RequestTerminationCode toe)
     Signature of the callback used by MHD to notify the application
     about completed requests.

    CLS
          custom value selected at callback registration time;

    CONNECTION
          connection handle;

    CON_CLS
          value as set by the last call to the
          `MHD_AccessHandlerCallback';

    TOE
          reason for request termination see
          `MHD_OPTION_NOTIFY_COMPLETED'.

 -- Function Pointer: int *MHD_KeyValueIterator (void *cls, enum
          MHD_ValueKind kind, const char *key, const char *value)
     Iterator over key-value pairs.  This iterator can be used to
     iterate over all of the cookies, headers, or `POST'-data fields of
     a request, and also to iterate over the headers that have been
     added to a response.

     Return `MHD_YES' to continue iterating, `MHD_NO' to abort the
     iteration.

 -- Function Pointer: int *MHD_ContentReaderCallback (void *cls,
          uint64_t pos, char *buf, int max)
     Callback used by MHD in order to obtain content.  The callback has
     to copy at most MAX bytes of content into BUF.  The total number
     of bytes that has been placed into BUF should be returned.

     Note that returning zero will cause MHD to try again, either
     "immediately" if in multi-threaded mode (in which case the callback
     may want to do blocking operations to avoid busy waiting) or in the
     next round if `MHD_run' is used.  Returning zero for a daemon that
     runs in internal `select()' mode is an error (since it would
     result in busy waiting) and cause the program to be aborted
     (`abort()').

    CLS
          custom value selected at callback registration time;

    POS
          position in the datastream to access; note that if an
          `MHD_Response' object is re-used, it is possible for the same
          content reader to be queried multiple times for the same
          data; however, if an `MHD_Response' is not re-used, MHD
          guarantees that POS will be the sum of all non-negative
          return values obtained from the content reader so far.

     Return `-1' on error (MHD will no longer try to read content and
     instead close the connection with the client).

 -- Function Pointer: void *MHD_ContentReaderFreeCallback (void *cls)
     This method is called by MHD if we are done with a content reader.
     It should be used to free resources associated with the content
     reader.

 -- Function Pointer: int *MHD_PostDataIterator (void *cls, enum
          MHD_ValueKind kind, const char *key, const char *filename,
          const char *content_type, const char *transfer_encoding,
          const char *data, uint64_t off, size_t size)
     Iterator over key-value pairs where the value maybe made available
     in increments and/or may not be zero-terminated.  Used for
     processing `POST' data.

    CLS
          custom value selected at callback registration time;

    KIND
          type of the value;

    KEY
          zero-terminated key for the value;

    FILENAME
          name of the uploaded file, `NULL' if not known;

    CONTENT_TYPE
          mime-type of the data, `NULL' if not known;

    TRANSFER_ENCODING
          encoding of the data, `NULL' if not known;

    DATA
          pointer to size bytes of data at the specified offset;

    OFF
          offset of data in the overall value;

    SIZE
          number of bytes in data available.

     Return `MHD_YES' to continue iterating, `MHD_NO' to abort the
     iteration.

5 Starting and stopping the server
**********************************

 -- Function: void MHD_set_panic_func (MHD_PanicCallback cb, void *cls)
     Set a handler for fatal errors.

    CB
          function to call if MHD encounteres a fatal internal error.
          If no handler was set explicitly, MHD will call `abort'.

    CLS
          closure argument for cb; the other arguments are the name of
          the source file, line number and a string describing the
          nature of the fatal error (which can be NULL)

 -- Function: struct MHD_Daemon * MHD_start_daemon (unsigned int flags,
          unsigned short port, MHD_AcceptPolicyCallback apc, void
          *apc_cls, MHD_AccessHandlerCallback dh, void *dh_cls, ...)
     Start a webserver on the given port.

    FLAGS
          OR-ed combination of `MHD_FLAG' values;

    PORT
          port to bind to;

    APC
          callback to call to check which clients will be allowed to
          connect; you can pass `NULL' in which case connections from
          any IP will be accepted;

    APC_CLS
          extra argument to APC;

    DH
          default handler for all URIs;

    DH_CLS
          extra argument to DH.

     Additional arguments are a list of options (type-value pairs,
     terminated with `MHD_OPTION_END'). It is mandatory to use
     `MHD_OPTION_END' as last argument, even when there are no
     additional arguments.

     Return `NULL' on error, handle to daemon on success.

 -- Function: void MHD_stop_daemon (struct MHD_Daemon *daemon)
     Shutdown an HTTP daemon.

 -- Function: int MHD_run (struct MHD_Daemon *daemon)
     Run webserver operations (without blocking unless in client
     callbacks).  This method should be called by clients in
     combination with `MHD_get_fdset()' if the client-controlled
     `select()' method is used.

     Return `MHD_YES' on success, `MHD_NO' if this daemon was not
     started with the right options for this call.

6 Implementing external `select'
********************************

 -- Function: int MHD_get_fdset (struct MHD_Daemon *daemon, fd_set *
          read_fd_set, fd_set * write_fd_set, fd_set * except_fd_set,
          int *max_fd)
     Obtain the `select()' sets for this daemon. The daemon's socket is
     added to READ_FD_SET. The list of currently existent connections
     is scanned and their file descriptors added to the correct set.

     *note Waiting for I/O: (libc)Waiting for I/O, for details on file
     descriptor sets.

     After the call completed successfully: the variable referenced by
     MAX_FD references the file descriptor with highest integer
     identifier. The variable must be set to zero before invoking this
     function.

     Return `MHD_YES' on success, `MHD_NO' if: the arguments are
     invalid (example: `NULL' pointers); this daemon was not started
     with the right options for this call.

 -- Function: int MHD_get_timeout (struct MHD_Daemon *daemon, unsigned
          long long *timeout)
     Obtain timeout value for select for this daemon (only needed if
     connection timeout is used).  The returned value is how long
     `select()' should at most block, not the timeout value set for
     connections.

          set to the timeout (in milliseconds).

     Return `MHD_YES' on success, `MHD_NO' if timeouts are not used (or
     no connections exist that would necessiate the use of a timeout
     right now).

7 Handling requests
*******************

 -- Function: int MHD_get_connection_values (struct MHD_Connection
          *connection, enum MHD_ValueKind kind, MHD_KeyValueIterator
          iterator, void *iterator_cls)
     Get all the headers matching KIND from the request.

     The ITERATOR callback is invoked once for each header, with
     ITERATOR_CLS as first argument. Return the number of entries
     iterated over; this can be less than the number of headers if,
     while iterating, ITERATOR returns `MHD_NO'.

     ITERATOR can be `NULL': in this case this function just counts and
     returns the number of headers.

 -- Function: int MHD_set_connection_value (struct MHD_Connection
          *connection, enum MHD_ValueKind kind, const char * key, const
          char * value)
     This function can be used to add an entry to the HTTP headers of a
     connection (so that the MHD_get_connection_values function will
     return them - and the MHD PostProcessor will also see them).  This
     maybe required in certain situations (see Mantis #1399) where
     (broken) HTTP implementations fail to supply values needed by the
     post processor (or other parts of the application).

     This function MUST only be called from within the
     MHD_AccessHandlerCallback (otherwise, access maybe improperly
     synchronized).  Furthermore, the client must guarantee that the
     key and value arguments are 0-terminated strings that are NOT
     freed until the connection is closed.  (The easiest way to do this
     is by passing only arguments to permanently allocated strings.).

     CONNECTION is the connection for which the entry for KEY of the
     given KIND should be set to the given VALUE.

     The function returns `MHD_NO' if the operation could not be
     performed due to insufficient memory and `MHD_YES' on success.

 -- Function: const char * MHD_lookup_connection_value (struct
          MHD_Connection *connection, enum MHD_ValueKind kind, const
          char *key)
     Get a particular header value.  If multiple values match the KIND,
     return one of them (the "first", whatever that means).  KEY must
     reference a zero-terminated ASCII-coded string representing the
     header to look for: it is compared against the headers using
     `strcasecmp()', so case is ignored.  Return `NULL' if no such item
     was found.

8 Building answers to responses
*******************************

Response objects handling by MHD is asynchronous with respect to the
application execution flow. Instances of the `MHD_Response' structure
are not associated to a daemon and neither to a client connection: they
are managed with reference counting.

   In the simplest case: we allocate a new `MHD_Response' structure for
each response, we use it once and finally we destroy it.

   MHD allows more efficient resources usages.

   Example: we allocate a new `MHD_Response' structure for each
response *kind*, we use it every time we have to give that responce and
we finally destroy it only when the daemon shuts down.

* Menu:

* microhttpd-response enqueue:: Enqueuing a response.
* microhttpd-response create::  Creating a response object.
* microhttpd-response headers:: Adding headers to a response.
* microhttpd-response inspect:: Inspecting a response object.


File: microhttpd.info,  Node: microhttpd-response enqueue,  Next: microhttpd-response create,  Up: microhttpd-responses

8.1 Enqueuing a response
========================

 -- Function: int MHD_queue_response (struct MHD_Connection
          *connection, unsigned int status_code, struct MHD_Response
          *response)
     Queue a response to be transmitted to the client as soon as
     possible but only after MHD_AccessHandlerCallback returns.  This
     function checks that it is legal to queue a response at this time
     for the given connection.  It also increments the internal
     reference counter for the response object (the counter will be
     decremented automatically once the response has been transmitted).

    CONNECTION
          the connection identifying the client;

    STATUS_CODE
          HTTP status code (i.e. `200' for OK);

    RESPONSE
          response to transmit.

     Return `MHD_YES' on success or if message has been queued.  Return
     `MHD_NO': if arguments are invalid (example: `NULL' pointer); on
     error (i.e. reply already sent).

 -- Function: void MHD_destroy_response (struct MHD_Response *response)
     Destroy a response object and associated resources (decrement the
     reference counter).  Note that MHD may keep some of the resources
     around if the response is still in the queue for some clients, so
     the memory may not necessarily be freed immediatley.

   An explanation of reference counting(1):

  1. a `MHD_Response' object is allocated:

          struct MHD_Response * response = MHD_create_response_from_data(...);
          /* here: reference counter = 1 */

  2. the `MHD_Response' object is enqueued in a `MHD_Connection':

          MHD_queue_response(connection, , response);
          /* here: reference counter = 2 */

  3. the creator of the response object discharges responsibility for
     it:

          MHD_destroy_response(response);
          /* here: reference counter = 1 */

  4. the daemon handles the connection sending the response's data to
     the client then decrements the reference counter by calling
     `MHD_destroy_response()': the counter's value drops to zero and
     the `MHD_Response' object is released.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) Note to readers acquainted to the Tcl API: reference counting on
`MHD_Connection' structures is handled in the same way as Tcl handles
`Tcl_Obj' structures through `Tcl_IncrRefCount()' and
`Tcl_DecrRefCount()'.

8.2 Creating response objects
=============================

 -- Function: struct MHD_Response * MHD_create_response_from_callback
          (uint64_t size, size_t block_size, MHD_ContentReaderCallback
          crc, void *crc_cls, MHD_ContentReaderFreeCallback crfc)
     Create a response object.  The response object can be extended with
     header information and then it can be used any number of times.

    SIZE
          size of the data portion of the response, `-1' for unknown;

    BLOCK_SIZE
          preferred block size for querying CRC (advisory only, MHD may
          still call CRC using smaller chunks); this is essentially the
          buffer size used for IO, clients should pick a value that is
          appropriate for IO and memory performance requirements;

    CRC
          callback to use to obtain response data;

    CRC_CLS
          extra argument to CRC;

    CRFC
          callback to call to free CRC_CLS resources.

     Return `NULL' on error (i.e. invalid arguments, out of memory).

 -- Function: struct MHD_Response * MHD_create_response_from_data
          (size_t size, void *data, int must_free, int must_copy)
     Create a response object.  The response object can be extended with
     header information and then it can be used any number of times.

    SIZE
          size of the data portion of the response;

    DATA
          the data itself;

    MUST_FREE
          if true: MHD should free data when done;

    MUST_COPY
          if true: MHD allocates a block of memory and use it to make a
          copy of DATA embedded in the returned `MHD_Response'
          structure; handling of the embedded memory is responsibility
          of MHD; DATA can be released anytime after this call returns.

     Return `NULL' on error (i.e. invalid arguments, out of memory).

   Example: create a response from a statically allocated string:

     const char * data = "<html><body><p>Error!</p></body></html>";

     struct MHD_Connection * connection = ...;
     struct MHD_Response *   response;

     response = MHD_create_response_from_data(strlen(data), data,
                                              MHD_NO, MHD_NO);
     MHD_queue_response(connection, 404, response);
     MHD_destroy_response(response);

8.3 Adding headers to a response
================================

 -- Function: int MHD_add_response_header (struct MHD_Response
          *response, const char *header, const char *content)
     Add a header line to the response. The strings referenced by
     HEADER and CONTENT must be zero-terminated and they are duplicated
     into memory blocks embedded in RESPONSE.

     Notice that the strings must not hold newlines, carriage returns
     or tab chars.

     Return `MHD_NO' on error (i.e. invalid header or content format or
     memory allocation error).

 -- Function: int MHD_del_response_header (struct MHD_Response
          *response, const char *header, const char *content)
     Delete a header line from the response.  Return `MHD_NO' on error
     (arguments are invalid or no such header known).

8.4 Inspecting a response object
================================

 -- Function: int MHD_get_response_headers (struct MHD_Response
          *response, MHD_KeyValueIterator iterator, void *iterator_cls)
     Get all of the headers added to a response.

     Invoke the ITERATOR callback for each header in the response,
     using ITERATOR_CLS as first argument. Return number of entries
     iterated over.  ITERATOR can be `NULL': in this case the function
     just counts headers.

     ITERATOR should not modify the its key and value arguments, unless
     we know what we are doing.

 -- Function: const char * MHD_get_response_header (struct MHD_Response
          *response, const char *key)
     Find and return a pointer to the value of a particular header from
     the response.  KEY must reference a zero-terminated string
     representing the header to look for. The search is case sensitive.
     Return `NULL' if header does not exist or KEY is `NULL'.

     We should not modify the value, unless we know what we are doing.

9 Adding a `POST' processor
***************************

* Menu:

* microhttpd-post api::         Programming interface for the
                                `POST' processor.

MHD provides the post procesor API to make it easier for applications to
parse the data of a client's `POST' request: the
`MHD_AccessHandlerCallback' will be invoked multiple times to process
data as it arrives; at each invocation a new chunk of data must be
processed. The arguments UPLOAD_DATA and UPLOAD_DATA_SIZE are used to
reference the chunk of data.

   When `MHD_AccessHandlerCallback' is invoked for a new connection:
its `*CON_CLS' argument is set to `NULL'. When `POST' data comes in the
upload buffer it is *mandatory* to use the CON_CLS to store a reference
to per-connection data.  The fact that the pointer was initially `NULL'
can be used to detect that this is a new request.

   One method to detect that a new connection was established is to set
`*con_cls' to anunused integer:

     int
     access_handler (void *cls,
                     struct MHD_Connection * connection,
                     const char *url,
                     const char *method, const char *version,
                     const char *upload_data, size_t *upload_data_size,
                     void **con_cls)
     {
       static int old_connection_marker;
       int new_connection = (MYNULL == *con_cls);

       if (new_connection)
         {
           /* new connection with POST */
           *con_cls = &old_connection_marker;
         }

       ...
     }

In contrast to the previous example, for `POST' requests in particular,
it is more common to use the value of `*con_cls' to keep track of
actual state used during processing, such as the post processor (or a
struct containing a post processor):

     int
     access_handler (void *cls,
                     struct MHD_Connection * connection,
                     const char *url,
                     const char *method, const char *version,
                     const char *upload_data, size_t *upload_data_size,
                     void **con_cls)
     {
       struct MHD_PostProcessor * pp = *con_cls;

       if (pp == NULL)
         {
           pp = MHD_create_post_processor(connection, ...);
           *con_cls = pp;
           return MHD_YES;
         }
       if (*upload_data_size)
         {
           MHD_post_process(pp, upload_data, *upload_data_size);
           *upload_data_size = 0;
           return MHD_YES;
         }
       else
         {
           MHD_destroy_post_processor(pp);
           return MHD_queue_response(...);
         }
     }

   Note that the callback from `MHD_OPTION_NOTIFY_COMPLETED' should be
used to destroy the post processor.  This cannot be done inside of the
access handler since the connection may not always terminate normally.

9.1 Programming interface for the `POST' processor
==================================================

 -- Function: struct MHD_PostProcessor * MHD_create_post_processor
          (struct MHD_Connection *connection, size_t buffer_size,
          MHD_PostDataIterator iterator, void *iterator_cls)
     Create a PostProcessor.  A PostProcessor can be used to
     (incrementally) parse the data portion of a `POST' request.

    CONNECTION
          the connection on which the `POST' is happening (used to
          determine the `POST' format);

    BUFFER_SIZE
          maximum number of bytes to use for internal buffering (used
          only for the parsing, specifically the parsing of the keys).
          A tiny value (256-1024) should be sufficient; do *NOT* use a
          value smaller than 256;

    ITERATOR
          iterator to be called with the parsed data; must *NOT* be
          `NULL';

    ITERATOR_CLS
          custom value to be used as first argument to ITERATOR.

     Return `NULL' on error (out of memory, unsupported encoding),
     otherwise a PP handle.

 -- Function: int MHD_post_process (struct MHD_PostProcessor *pp, const
          char *post_data, size_t post_data_len)
     Parse and process `POST' data.  Call this function when `POST'
     data is available (usually during an `MHD_AccessHandlerCallback')
     with the UPLOAD_DATA and UPLOAD_DATA_SIZE.  Whenever possible,
     this will then cause calls to the
     `MHD_IncrementalKeyValueIterator'.

    PP
          the post processor;

    POST_DATA
          POST_DATA_LEN bytes of `POST' data;

    POST_DATA_LEN
          length of POST_DATA.

     Return `MHD_YES' on success, `MHD_NO' on error (out-of-memory,
     iterator aborted, parse error).

 -- Function: int MHD_destroy_post_processor (struct MHD_PostProcessor
          *pp)
     Release PostProcessor resources.  After this function is being
     called, the PostProcessor is guaranteed to no longer call its
     iterator.  There is no special call to the iterator to indicate
     the end of the post processing stream.  After destroying the
     PostProcessor, the programmer should perform any necessary work to
     complete the processing of the iterator.

     Return `MHD_YES' if processing completed nicely, `MHD_NO' if there
     were spurious characters or formatting problems with the post
     request.  It is common to ignore the return value of this function.

                      Version 2.1, February 1999

     Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
     51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301, USA

     Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
     of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

     [This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also counts
     as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence the
     version number 2.1.]

Preamble
--------

The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom
to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public Licenses
are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.

   This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some
specially designated software--typically libraries--of the Free
Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You can use
it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether this
license or the ordinary General Public License is the better strategy to
use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.

   When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,
not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that
you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge
for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get
it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of it
in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do these
things.

   To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these
rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for
you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.

   For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide
complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them
with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling
it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.

   We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the
library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal
permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.

   To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that
there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is
modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know that
what they have is not the original version, so that the original
author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be
introduced by others.

   Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of
any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot
effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a
restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that
any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be
consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.

   Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the
ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser
General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and is
quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use this
license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those
libraries into non-free programs.

   When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using
a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a
combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary
General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the
entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General
Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with
the library.

   We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it
does _Less_ to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General
Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less
of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages
are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many
libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain
special circumstances.

   For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to
encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it
becomes a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be
allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free
library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this
case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free
software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.

   In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free
programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of free
software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in non-free
programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU operating
system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating system.

   Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the
users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is
linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run that
program using a modified version of the Library.

   The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a
"work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".  The
former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must
be combined with the library in order to run.

TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
---------------------------------------------------------------

  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other
     program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or
     other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the
     terms of this Lesser General Public License (also called "this
     License").  Each licensee is addressed as "you".

     A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data
     prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
     (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.

     The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work
     which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on the
     Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under
     copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a
     portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or
     translated straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter,
     translation is included without limitation in the term
     "modification".)

     "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
     making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code
     means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
     associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
     control compilation and installation of the library.

     Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are
     not covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act
     of running a program using the Library is not restricted, and
     output from such a program is covered only if its contents
     constitute a work based on the Library (independent of the use of
     the Library in a tool for writing it).  Whether that is true
     depends on what the Library does and what the program that uses
     the Library does.

  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's
     complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided
     that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
     appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep
     intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the
     absence of any warranty; and distribute a copy of this License
     along with the Library.

     You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
     and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange
     for a fee.

  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion
     of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and
     distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
     above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

       a. The modified work must itself be a software library.

       b. You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
          stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

       c. You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
          charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.

       d. If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or
          a table of data to be supplied by an application program that
          uses the facility, other than as an argument passed when the
          facility is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort
          to ensure that, in the event an application does not supply
          such function or table, the facility still operates, and
          performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful.

          (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots
          has a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
          application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
          application-supplied function or table used by this function
          must be optional: if the application does not supply it, the
          square root function must still compute square roots.)

     These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
     identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the
     Library, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate
     works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not
     apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate
     works.  But when you distribute the same sections as part of a
     whole which is a work based on the Library, the distribution of
     the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions
     for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each
     and every part regardless of who wrote it.

     Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or
     contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the
     intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of
     derivative or collective works based on the Library.

     In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the
     Library with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on
     a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the
     other work under the scope of this License.

  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
     License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.
     To do this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this
     License, so that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public
     License, version 2, instead of to this License.  (If a newer
     version than version 2 of the ordinary GNU General Public License
     has appeared, then you can specify that version instead if you
     wish.)  Do not make any other change in these notices.

     Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
     that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to
     all subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.

     This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of
     the Library into a program that is not a library.

  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or
     derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable
     form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you
     accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
     source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
     1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software
     interchange.

     If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
     from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy
     the source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
     distribute the source code, even though third parties are not
     compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
     Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being
     compiled or linked with it, is called a "work that uses the
     Library".  Such a work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of
     the Library, and therefore falls outside the scope of this License.

     However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library
     creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because
     it contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that
     uses the library".  The executable is therefore covered by this
     License.  Section 6 states terms for distribution of such
     executables.

     When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header
     file that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may
     be a derivative work of the Library even though the source code is
     not.  Whether this is true is especially significant if the work
     can be linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a
     library.  The threshold for this to be true is not precisely
     defined by law.

     If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
     structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
     functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
     file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a
     derivative work.  (Executables containing this object code plus
     portions of the Library will still fall under Section 6.)

     Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
     distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section
     6.  Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
     whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.

  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or
     link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a
     work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work
     under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit
     modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
     engineering for debugging such modifications.

     You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
     Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered
     by this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the
     work during execution displays copyright notices, you must include
     the copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a
     reference directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also,
     you must do one of these things:

       a. Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
          machine-readable source code for the Library including
          whatever changes were used in the work (which must be
          distributed under Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work
          is an executable linked with the Library, with the complete
          machine-readable "work that uses the Library", as object code
          and/or source code, so that the user can modify the Library
          and then relink to produce a modified executable containing
          the modified Library.  (It is understood that the user who
          changes the contents of definitions files in the Library will
          not necessarily be able to recompile the application to use
          the modified definitions.)

       b. Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
          Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run
          time a copy of the library already present on the user's
          computer system, rather than copying library functions into
          the executable, and (2) will operate properly with a modified
          version of the library, if the user installs one, as long as
          the modified version is interface-compatible with the version
          that the work was made with.

       c. Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least
          three years, to give the same user the materials specified in
          Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more than the cost of
          performing this distribution.

       d. If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy
          from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the
          above specified materials from the same place.

       e. Verify that the user has already received a copy of these
          materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.

     For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the
     Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for
     reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special
     exception, the materials to be distributed need not include
     anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
     form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of
     the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that
     component itself accompanies the executable.

     It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
     restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
     accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you
     cannot use both them and the Library together in an executable
     that you distribute.

  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
     Library side-by-side in a single library together with other
     library facilities not covered by this License, and distribute
     such a combined library, provided that the separate distribution
     of the work based on the Library and of the other library
     facilities is otherwise permitted, and provided that you do these
     two things:

       a. Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
          based on the Library, uncombined with any other library
          facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the
          Sections above.

       b. Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact
          that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining
          where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same
          work.

  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the
     Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any
     attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or
     distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate
     your rights under this License.  However, parties who have
     received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not
     have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in
     full compliance.

  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
     signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify
     or distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions
     are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.
     Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Library (or any work
     based on the Library), you indicate your acceptance of this
     License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying,
     distributing or modifying the Library or works based on it.

 10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
     Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
     original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the
     Library subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose
     any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights
     granted herein.  You are not responsible for enforcing compliance
     by third parties with this License.

 11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
     infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent
     issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order,
     agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this
     License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this
     License.  If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously
     your obligations under this License and any other pertinent
     obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the
     Library at all.  For example, if a patent license would not permit
     royalty-free redistribution of the Library by all those who
     receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only
     way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain
     entirely from distribution of the Library.

     If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable
     under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is
     intended to apply, and the section as a whole is intended to apply
     in other circumstances.

     It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
     patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of
     any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting
     the integrity of the free software distribution system which is
     implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
     generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
     through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
     system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is
     willing to distribute software through any other system and a
     licensee cannot impose that choice.

     This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed
     to be a consequence of the rest of this License.

 12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
     certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces,
     the original copyright holder who places the Library under this
     License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation
     excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only
     in or among countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this
     License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of
     this License.

 13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
     versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.
     Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
     but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

     Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the
     Library specifies a version number of this License which applies
     to it and "any later version", you have the option of following
     the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later
     version published by the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library
     does not specify a license version number, you may choose any
     version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

 14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
     programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,
     write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is
     copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
     Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our
     decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free
     status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting
     the sharing and reuse of software generally.

                                NO WARRANTY

 15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
     WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE
     LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
     HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT
     WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT
     NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND
     FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE
     QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
     LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY
     SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

 16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
     WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY
     MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE
     LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL,
     INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR
     INABILITY TO USE THE LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF
     DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU
     OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY
     OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN
     ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

                      END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries
----------------------------------------------

If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that
everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting
redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of
the ordinary General Public License).

   To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.
It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most
effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have
at least the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is
found.

     ONE LINE TO GIVE THE LIBRARY'S NAME AND AN IDEA OF WHAT IT DOES.
     Copyright (C) YEAR  NAME OF AUTHOR

                         Version 2, June 1991

     Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
     59 Temple Place - Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307, USA

     Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
     of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

Preamble
--------

The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom
to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public License is
intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
your programs, too.

   When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in
new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

   To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

   For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
rights.

   We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software,
and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the software.

   Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
authors' reputations.

   Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

   The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
  1. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a
     notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
     under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program",
     below, refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on
     the Program" means either the Program or any derivative work under
     copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Program or a
     portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or
     translated into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is
     included without limitation in the term "modification".)  Each
     licensee is addressed as "you".

     Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are
     not covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act
     of running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the
     Program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on
     the Program (independent of having been made by running the
     Program).  Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.

  2. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
     source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
     conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
     copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
     notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
     warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of
     this License along with the Program.

     You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
     and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange
     for a fee.

  3. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
     of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
     distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
     above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

       a. You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

       b. You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that
          in whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program
          or any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge
          to all third parties under the terms of this License.

       c. If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
          when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
          interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display
          an announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and
          a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you
          provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the
          program under these conditions, and telling the user how to
          view a copy of this License.  (Exception: if the Program
          itself is interactive but does not normally print such an
          announcement, your work based on the Program is not required
          to print an announcement.)

     These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
     identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the
     Program, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate
     works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not
     apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate
     works.  But when you distribute the same sections as part of a
     whole which is a work based on the Program, the distribution of
     the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions
     for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each
     and every part regardless of who wrote it.

     Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or
     contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the
     intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of
     derivative or collective works based on the Program.

     In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the
     Program with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on
     a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the
     other work under the scope of this License.

  4. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
     under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms
     of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the
     following:

       a. Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
          source code, which must be distributed under the terms of
          Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for
          software interchange; or,

       b. Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
          years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
          cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
          machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
          distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
          medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

       c. Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
          to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
          allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
          received the program in object code or executable form with
          such an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)

     The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
     making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete
     source code means all the source code for all modules it contains,
     plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts
     used to control compilation and installation of the executable.
     However, as a special exception, the source code distributed need
     not include anything that is normally distributed (in either
     source or binary form) with the major components (compiler,
     kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable
     runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable.

     If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
     access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
     access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
     distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
     compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

  5. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
     except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
     otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
     void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this
     License.  However, parties who have received copies, or rights,
     from you under this License will not have their licenses
     terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

  6. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
     signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify
     or distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions
     are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.
     Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or any work
     based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this
     License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying,
     distributing or modifying the Program or works based on it.

  7. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
     Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
     original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program
     subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any
     further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights
     granted herein.  You are not responsible for enforcing compliance
     by third parties to this License.

  8. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
     infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent
     issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order,
     agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this
     License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this
     License.  If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously
     your obligations under this License and any other pertinent
     obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the
     Program at all.  For example, if a patent license would not permit
     royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who
     receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only
     way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain
     entirely from distribution of the Program.

     If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable
     under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is
     intended to apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply
     in other circumstances.

     It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
     patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of
     any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting
     the integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
     implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
     generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
     through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
     system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is
     willing to distribute software through any other system and a
     licensee cannot impose that choice.

     This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed
     to be a consequence of the rest of this License.

  9. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
     certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces,
     the original copyright holder who places the Program under this
     License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation
     excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only
     in or among countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this
     License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of
     this License.

 10. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
     versions of the General Public License from time to time.  Such
     new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but
     may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

     Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the
     Program specifies a version number of this License which applies
     to it and "any later version", you have the option of following
     the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later
     version published by the Free Software Foundation.  If the Program
     does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose
     any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

 11. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
     programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the
     author to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted
     by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software
     Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our decision
     will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of
     all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
     and reuse of software generally.

                                NO WARRANTY
 12. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
     WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE
     LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
     HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT
     WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT
     NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND
     FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE
     QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
     PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY
     SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

 13. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
     WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY
     MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE
     LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL,
     INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR
     INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF
     DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU
     OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY
     OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN
     ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

                               ECOS EXTENSION
 14. As a special exception, if other files instantiate templates or use
     macros or inline functions from this file, or you compile this file
     and link it with other works to produce a work based on this file,
     this file does not by itself cause the resulting work to be
     covered by the GNU General Public License. However the source code
     for this file must still be made available in accordance with
     section (3) of the GNU General Public License v2.

     This exception does not invalidate any other reasons why a work
     based on this file might be covered by the GNU General Public
     License.


                      END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
=============================================

If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these
terms.

   To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

     ONE LINE TO GIVE THE PROGRAM'S NAME AND AN IDEA OF WHAT IT DOES.
     Copyright (C) 19YY  NAME OF AUTHOR

     This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
     modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License
     as published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 2
     of the License, or (at your option) any later version.

     This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
     but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
     MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
     GNU General Public License for more details.

     You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along
     with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc.,
     59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307, USA.

   Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper
mail.

   If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like
this when it starts in an interactive mode:

     Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) 19YY NAME OF AUTHOR
     Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details
     type `show w'.  This is free software, and you are welcome
     to redistribute it under certain conditions; type `show c'
     for details.

   The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the
appropriate parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the
commands you use may be called something other than `show w' and `show
c'; they could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your
program.

   You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or
your school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program,
if necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:

     Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright
     interest in the program `Gnomovision'
     (which makes passes at compilers) written
     by James Hacker.

     SIGNATURE OF TY COON, 1 April 1989
     Ty Coon, President of Vice

   This General Public License does not permit incorporating your
program into proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine
library, you may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary
applications with the library.  If this is what you want to do, use the
GNU Library General Public License instead of this License.

                     Version 1.3, 3 November 2008

     Copyright (C) 2000, 2001, 2002, 2007, 2008 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
     `http://fsf.org/'

     Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
     of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

  0. PREAMBLE

     The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
     functional and useful document "free" in the sense of freedom: to
     assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,
     with or without modifying it, either commercially or
     noncommercially.  Secondarily, this License preserves for the
     author and publisher a way to get credit for their work, while not
     being considered responsible for modifications made by others.

     This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative
     works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.
     It complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
     license designed for free software.

     We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for
     free software, because free software needs free documentation: a
     free program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms
     that the software does.  But this License is not limited to
     software manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless
     of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed book.
     We recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is
     instruction or reference.

  1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

     This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium,
     that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it
     can be distributed under the terms of this License.  Such a notice
     grants a world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration,
     to use that work under the conditions stated herein.  The
     "Document", below, refers to any such manual or work.  Any member
     of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as "you".  You
     accept the license if you copy, modify or distribute the work in a
     way requiring permission under copyright law.

     A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the
     Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
     modifications and/or translated into another language.

     A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section
     of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
     publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall
     subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could
     fall directly within that overall subject.  (Thus, if the Document
     is in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not
     explain any mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of
     historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or
     of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position
     regarding them.

     The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose
     titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in
     the notice that says that the Document is released under this
     License.  If a section does not fit the above definition of
     Secondary then it is not allowed to be designated as Invariant.
     The Document may contain zero Invariant Sections.  If the Document
     does not identify any Invariant Sections then there are none.

     The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are
     listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice
     that says that the Document is released under this License.  A
     Front-Cover Text may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may
     be at most 25 words.

     A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
     represented in a format whose specification is available to the
     general public, that is suitable for revising the document
     straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images
     composed of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some
     widely available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to
     text formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of
     formats suitable for input to text formatters.  A copy made in an
     otherwise Transparent file format whose markup, or absence of
     markup, has been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent
     modification by readers is not Transparent.  An image format is
     not Transparent if used for any substantial amount of text.  A
     copy that is not "Transparent" is called "Opaque".

     Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
     ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format,
     SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and
     standard-conforming simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for
     human modification.  Examples of transparent image formats include
     PNG, XCF and JPG.  Opaque formats include proprietary formats that
     can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or
     XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally
     available, and the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF
     produced by some word processors for output purposes only.

     The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
     plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the
     material this License requires to appear in the title page.  For
     works in formats which do not have any title page as such, "Title
     Page" means the text near the most prominent appearance of the
     work's title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

     The "publisher" means any person or entity that distributes copies
     of the Document to the public.

     A section "Entitled XYZ" means a named subunit of the Document
     whose title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses
     following text that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ
     stands for a specific section name mentioned below, such as
     "Acknowledgements", "Dedications", "Endorsements", or "History".)
     To "Preserve the Title" of such a section when you modify the
     Document means that it remains a section "Entitled XYZ" according
     to this definition.

     The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice
     which states that this License applies to the Document.  These
     Warranty Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in
     this License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other
     implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and
     has no effect on the meaning of this License.

  2. VERBATIM COPYING

     You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
     commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
     copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License
     applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you
     add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You
     may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading
     or further copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However,
     you may accept compensation in exchange for copies.  If you
     distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow
     the conditions in section 3.

     You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above,
     and you may publicly display copies.

  3. COPYING IN QUANTITY

     If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly
     have printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and
     the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must
     enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all
     these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and
     Back-Cover Texts on the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly
     and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies.  The
     front cover must present the full title with all words of the
     title equally prominent and visible.  You may add other material
     on the covers in addition.  Copying with changes limited to the
     covers, as long as they preserve the title of the Document and
     satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in
     other respects.

     If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
     legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
     reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto
     adjacent pages.

     If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document
     numbering more than 100, you must either include a
     machine-readable Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or
     state in or with each Opaque copy a computer-network location from
     which the general network-using public has access to download
     using public-standard network protocols a complete Transparent
     copy of the Document, free of added material.  If you use the
     latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you
     begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that
     this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated
     location until at least one year after the last time you
     distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or
     retailers) of that edition to the public.

     It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of
     the Document well before redistributing any large number of
     copies, to give them a chance to provide you with an updated
     version of the Document.

  4. MODIFICATIONS

     You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document
     under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you
     release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with
     the Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus
     licensing distribution and modification of the Modified Version to
     whoever possesses a copy of it.  In addition, you must do these
     things in the Modified Version:

       A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title
          distinct from that of the Document, and from those of
          previous versions (which should, if there were any, be listed
          in the History section of the Document).  You may use the
          same title as a previous version if the original publisher of
          that version gives permission.

       B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or
          entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in
          the Modified Version, together with at least five of the
          principal authors of the Document (all of its principal
          authors, if it has fewer than five), unless they release you
          from this requirement.

       C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
          Modified Version, as the publisher.

       D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.

       E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
          adjacent to the other copyright notices.

       F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license
          notice giving the public permission to use the Modified
          Version under the terms of this License, in the form shown in
          the Addendum below.

       G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant
          Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document's
          license notice.

       H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.

       I. Preserve the section Entitled "History", Preserve its Title,
          and add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new
          authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on
          the Title Page.  If there is no section Entitled "History" in
          the Document, create one stating the title, year, authors,
          and publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page,
          then add an item describing the Modified Version as stated in
          the previous sentence.

       J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document
          for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and
          likewise the network locations given in the Document for
          previous versions it was based on.  These may be placed in
          the "History" section.  You may omit a network location for a
          work that was published at least four years before the
          Document itself, or if the original publisher of the version
          it refers to gives permission.

       K. For any section Entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications",
          Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the
          section all the substance and tone of each of the contributor
          acknowledgements and/or dedications given therein.

       L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,
          unaltered in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers
          or the equivalent are not considered part of the section
          titles.

       M. Delete any section Entitled "Endorsements".  Such a section
          may not be included in the Modified Version.

       N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled
          "Endorsements" or to conflict in title with any Invariant
          Section.

       O. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.

     If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
     appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no
     material copied from the Document, you may at your option
     designate some or all of these sections as invariant.  To do this,
     add their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified
     Version's license notice.  These titles must be distinct from any
     other section titles.

     You may add a section Entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains
     nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
     parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text
     has been approved by an organization as the authoritative
     definition of a standard.

     You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text,
     and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end
     of the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one
     passage of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be
     added by (or through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the
     Document already includes a cover text for the same cover,
     previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same entity
     you are acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may
     replace the old one, on explicit permission from the previous
     publisher that added the old one.

     The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this
     License give permission to use their names for publicity for or to
     assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version.

  5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS

     You may combine the Document with other documents released under
     this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for
     modified versions, provided that you include in the combination
     all of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents,
     unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your
     combined work in its license notice, and that you preserve all
     their Warranty Disclaimers.

     The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
     multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
     copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name
     but different contents, make the title of each such section unique
     by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the
     original author or publisher of that section if known, or else a
     unique number.  Make the same adjustment to the section titles in
     the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the
     combined work.

     In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled
     "History" in the various original documents, forming one section
     Entitled "History"; likewise combine any sections Entitled
     "Acknowledgements", and any sections Entitled "Dedications".  You
     must delete all sections Entitled "Endorsements."

  6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

     You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other
     documents released under this License, and replace the individual
     copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy
     that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the
     rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the
     documents in all other respects.

     You may extract a single document from such a collection, and
     distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert
     a copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow
     this License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of
     that document.

  7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

     A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other
     separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of
     a storage or distribution medium, is called an "aggregate" if the
     copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the
     legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the individual
     works permit.  When the Document is included in an aggregate, this
     License does not apply to the other works in the aggregate which
     are not themselves derivative works of the Document.

     If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
     copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half
     of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed
     on covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the
     electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic
     form.  Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket
     the whole aggregate.

  8. TRANSLATION

     Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
     distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section
     4.  Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
     permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
     translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
     original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
     translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
     Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also
     include the original English version of this License and the
     original versions of those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a
     disagreement between the translation and the original version of
     this License or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will
     prevail.

     If a section in the Document is Entitled "Acknowledgements",
     "Dedications", or "History", the requirement (section 4) to
     Preserve its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the
     actual title.

  9. TERMINATION

     You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
     except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
     otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute it is void,
     and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.

     However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
     license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
     provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly
     and finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the
     copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some
     reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.

     Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
     reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
     violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
     received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from
     that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days
     after your receipt of the notice.

     Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate
     the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from
     you under this License.  If your rights have been terminated and
     not permanently reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of
     the same material does not give you any rights to use it.

 10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

     The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of
     the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
     versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
     differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
     `http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/'.

     Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version
     number.  If the Document specifies that a particular numbered
     version of this License "or any later version" applies to it, you
     have the option of following the terms and conditions either of
     that specified version or of any later version that has been
     published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.  If
     the Document does not specify a version number of this License,
     you may choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the
     Free Software Foundation.  If the Document specifies that a proxy
     can decide which future versions of this License can be used, that
     proxy's public statement of acceptance of a version permanently
     authorizes you to choose that version for the Document.

 11. RELICENSING

     "Massive Multiauthor Collaboration Site" (or "MMC Site") means any
     World Wide Web server that publishes copyrightable works and also
     provides prominent facilities for anybody to edit those works.  A
     public wiki that anybody can edit is an example of such a server.
     A "Massive Multiauthor Collaboration" (or "MMC") contained in the
     site means any set of copyrightable works thus published on the MMC
     site.

     "CC-BY-SA" means the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0
     license published by Creative Commons Corporation, a not-for-profit
     corporation with a principal place of business in San Francisco,
     California, as well as future copyleft versions of that license
     published by that same organization.

     "Incorporate" means to publish or republish a Document, in whole or
     in part, as part of another Document.

     An MMC is "eligible for relicensing" if it is licensed under this
     License, and if all works that were first published under this
     License somewhere other than this MMC, and subsequently
     incorporated in whole or in part into the MMC, (1) had no cover
     texts or invariant sections, and (2) were thus incorporated prior
     to November 1, 2008.

     The operator of an MMC Site may republish an MMC contained in the
     site under CC-BY-SA on the same site at any time before August 1,
     2009, provided the MMC is eligible for relicensing.


ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents
====================================================

To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
the License in the document and put the following copyright and license
notices just after the title page:

       Copyright (C)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.
       Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
       under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.3
       or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
       with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover
       Texts.  A copy of the license is included in the section entitled ``GNU
       Free Documentation License''.

   If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover
Texts, replace the "with...Texts." line with this:

         with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with
         the Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts
         being LIST.

   If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other
combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the
situation.

   If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of
free software license, such as the GNU General Public License, to
permit their use in free software.
