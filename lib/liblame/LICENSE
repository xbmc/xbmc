Can I use LAME in my commercial program?  

Yes, you can, under the restrictions of the LGPL.  The easiest
way to do this is to:

1. Link to LAME as separate library (libmp3lame.a on unix or 
   lame_enc.dll or libmp3lame.dll on windows)

2. Fully acknowledge that you are using LAME, and give a link
   to our web site, www.mp3dev.org

3. If you make modifications to LAME, you *must* release these
   these modifications back to the LAME project, under the LGPL.
