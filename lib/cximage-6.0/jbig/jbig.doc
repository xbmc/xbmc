This text explains how to use the functions provided by the JBIG-KIT
portable image compression library in your application software.


1  Introduction to JBIG

We start with a short introduction to JBIG1. More detailed information
is provided in the "Introduction and overview" section of the JBIG1
standard. Information on how to obtain a copy of the standard is
available from <http://www.itu.int/> or <http://www.iso.ch/>.

Image data encoded with the JBIG algorithm is separated into planes,
layers, and stripes. Each plane contains one bit per pixel. The number
of planes stored in a JBIG data stream is the number of bits per
pixel. Resolution layers are numbered from 0 to D with 0 being the
layer with the lowest resolution and D the one with the highest. Each
next higher resolution layer has twice the number of rows and columns.
Layer 0 is encoded independently of any other data, all other
resolution layers are encoded as only the difference between the next
lower and the current layer. For applications that require very quick
access to parts of an image, it is possible to divide an image into
several horizontal stripes. All stripes of one resolution layer have
equal size, except perhaps the final one. The number of stripes of an
image is equal in all resolution layers and in all bit planes.

The compressed data stream specified by the JBIG standard is called a
bi-level image entity (BIE). A BIE consists of a 20-byte header,
followed by an optional 1728-byte table (usually not present, except
in special applications) followed by a sequence of stripe data
entities (SDE). Each SDE encodes the content of one single stripe in
one plane of one resolution layer. Between the SDEs, other information
blocks (called floating marker segments) can also be present. They are
used to change certain parameters of the algorithm in the middle of an
image or contain additional application specific information. A BIE
looks like this:


          +------------------------------------------------+
          |                                                |
          |  20-byte header (with image size, #planes,     |
          |  #layers, stripe size, first layer, options,   |
          |  SDE ordering, ...)                            |
          |                                                |
          +------------------------------------------------+
          |                                                |

          |                                                |
          +------------------------------------------------+

          |       optional floating marker segments        |
          |                                                |
          +------------------------------------------------+
          |                                                |

          |                                                |
          +------------------------------------------------+
            ...
          +------------------------------------------------+
          |                                                |
          |              stripe data entity                |
          |                                                |
          +------------------------------------------------+


One BIE can contain all resolution layers of an image, but it is also
possible to store various resolution layers in several BIEs. The BIE
header contains the number of the first and the last resolution layer
stored in this BIE, as well as the size of the highest resolution
layer stored in this BIE. Progressive coding is deactivated by simply
storing the image in one single resolution layer.

Different applications might have different requirements for the order
in which the SDEs for stripes of various planes and layers are stored
in the BIE, so all possible sensible orderings are allowed by the
standard and indicated by four bits in the header.

It is possible to use the raw BIE data stream as specified by the JBIG
standard directly as the format of a file used for storing images.
This is what the pbmtojbg and jbgtopbm conversion tools do that are
provided in this package as demonstration applications. However, as
the BIE format has been designed for a large number of very different
applications, and to allow efficient direct processing by special JBIG
hardware chip implementations, the BIE header contains only the
minimum amount of information absolutely required by the decompression
algorithm. Many features expected from a good file format are missing
in the BIE data stream:

  - no "magic code" in the first few bytes to allow identification
    of the file format on a typeless file system and to allow
    automatic distinction from other compression algorithms

  - no standardized way to encode additional information such as a
    textual description, information about the meaning of various bit
    planes, the physical size and resolution of the document, etc.

  - a checksum to ensure image integrity

  - encryption and signature mechanisms

  - many things more

Raw BIE data streams alone may therefore not be a suitable format for
document archiving and exchange. A standard format for this purpose
would typically combine a BIE representing the image data with an
additional header providing auxiliary information into one file.
Existing established multi-purpose file formats with a rich set of
auxiliary information attributes like TIFF could be extended easily to
also hold JBIG compressed data.

On the other hand, in database applications for instance, a BIE might
be stored directly in a variable length field. Auxiliary information
would then be stored in other fields of the same record, to simply
search operations.


2  Compressing an image

2.1  Format of the source image

To be processed by the JBIG-KIT encoder, the image has to be present
in memory as separate bitmap planes. Each byte of a bitmap contains
eight pixels, where the most significant bit represents the leftmost
of these. Each line of a bitmap has to be stored in an integral number
of bytes. If the image width is not an integral multiple of eight,
then the final byte has to be padded with zero bits.

For example the 23x5 pixels large single plane image:

   .XXXXX..XXX...X...XXX..
   .....X..X..X..X..X.....
   .....X..XXX...X..X.XXX.
   .X...X..X..X..X..X...X.
   ..XXX...XXX...X...XXX..

is represented by the 15 bytes

   01111100 11100010 00111000
   00000100 10010010 01000000
   00000100 11100010 01011100
   01000100 10010010 01000100
   00111000 11100010 00111000

or in hexadecimal notation

   7c e2 38 04 92 40 04 e2 5c 44 92 44 38 e2 38

This is the format used in binary PBM files and it can also be handled
directly by the Xlib library of the X Window System.

As JBIG can also handle images with multiple bit planes, the JBIG-KIT
library functions accept and return always arrays of pointers to
bitmaps with one pointer per plane.

For single-plane images, the standard recommends that a 0 pixel
represents the background and a 1 pixel represents the foreground
color of an image, in other words, 0 is white and 1 is black for
scanned paper documents. For images with several bits per pixel, the
JBIG standard makes no recommendations about how various colors should
be encoded.

For greyscale images, by using a Gray code instead of a simple binary
weighted representation of the pixel intensity, some increase in
coding efficiency can be reached.

A Gray code is also a binary representation of integer numbers, but it
has the property that the representations of the integer numbers i and
(i+1) always differ in exactly one bit. For example, the numbers 0 to
7 can be represented in normal binary code and Gray code as in the
following table:

                           normal
              number    binary code     Gray code
            ---------------------------------------
                0           000            000
                1           001            001
                2           010            011
                3           011            010
                4           100            110
                5           101            111
                6           110            101
                7           111            100

The form of Gray code shown above has the property that the second
half of the code (numbers 4 - 7) is simply the mirrored first half
(numbers 3 - 0) with the first bit set to one. This way, arbitrarily
large Gray codes can be generated quickly by mirroring the above
example and prefixing the first half with zeros and the second half
with ones as often as required. In greyscale images, it is common
practise to use the all-0 code for black and the all-1 code for white.

No matter whether a Gray code or a binary code is used for encoding a
pixel intensity in several bit planes, it always makes sense to store
the most significant (leftmost) bit in plane 0, which is transmitted
first. This way, a decoder could increase the precision of the
displayed pixel intensities while data is still being received and the
basic structure of the image will become visible as early as possible
during the transmission.


2.2  A simple compression application

In order to use JBIG-KIT in your application, just link libjbig.a to
your executable (on Unix systems just add -ljbig and -L. to the
command line options of your compiler, on other systems you will have
to write a new Makefile anyway), copy the file jbig.h into your source
directory and put the line

  #include "jbig.h"

into your source code.

The library interface follows object-oriented programming principles.
You have to declare a variable (object)

  struct jbg_enc_state se;

which contains the current status of an encoder. Then you initialize
the encoder by calling the constructor function

  void jbg_enc_init(struct jbg_enc_state *s, unsigned long x, unsigned long y,
                    int pl, unsigned char **p,
                    void (*data_out)(unsigned char *start, size_t len,
                                     void *file),
                    void *file);

The parameters have the following meaning:

  s             A pointer to the jbg_enc_state structure which you want
                to initialize.

  x             The width of your image.

  y             The height of your image.

  pl            the number of bitmap planes you want to encode.

  p             A pointer to an array of pl pointers, where each is again
                pointing to the first byte of a bitmap as described in
                section 2.1.

  data_out      This is a call-back function which will be called during
                the compression process by libjbig in order to deliver
                the BIE data to the application. The parameters of the
                function data_out are a pointer start to the new block
                of data to be delivered, as well as the number len of
                delivered bytes. The pointer file is transparently
                delivered to data_out, as specified in jbg_enc_init().
                Typically, data_out will write the BIE portion to a
                file, send it to a network connection, or append it to
                some memory buffer.

  file          A pointer parameter that is passed on to data_out()
                and can be used, for instance, to allow data_out() to
                distinguish by which compression task it has been
                called in multi-threaded applications.

In the simplest case, the compression is then started by calling the
function

  void jbg_enc_out(struct jbg_enc_state *s);

which will deliver the complete BIE to data_out() in several calls.
After jbg_enc_out has returned, a call to the destructor function

  void jbg_enc_free(struct jbg_enc_state *s);

will release any heap memory allocated by the previous functions.


A minimal example application which sends the BIE of the above
bitmap to stdout looks like this:

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
/* A sample JBIG encoding application */

#include <stdio.h>
#include "jbig.h"

void output_bie(unsigned char *start, size_t len, void *file)
{
  fwrite(start, 1, len, (FILE *) file);
  
  return;
}

int main()
{
  unsigned char bitmap[15] = {
    /* 23 x 5 pixels, "JBIG" */
    0x7c, 0xe2, 0x38, 0x04, 0x92, 0x40, 0x04, 0xe2,
    0x5c, 0x44, 0x92, 0x44, 0x38, 0xe2, 0x38
  };
  unsigned char *bitmaps[1] = { bitmap };
  struct jbg_enc_state se;
  
  jbg_enc_init(&se, 23, 5, 1, bitmaps, 
	       output_bie, stdout);              /* initialize encoder */
  jbg_enc_out(&se);                                    /* encode image */
  jbg_enc_free(&se);                    /* release allocated resources */
  
  return 0;
}
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

This software produces a 42 byte long BIE. (JBIG is not very good at
compressing extremely small images like in this example, because the
arithmetic encoder requires some startup data in order to generate
reasonable statistics which influence the compression process and
because there is some header overhead.)


2.3  More about compression

If jbg_enc_out() is called directly after jbg_enc_init(), the
following default values are used for various compression parameters:

  - Only one single resolution layer is used, i.e. no progressive
    mode.

  - The number of lines per stripe is selected so that approximately
    35 stripes per image are used (as recommended in annex C of the
    standard together with the suggested adaptive template change
    algorithm). However, not less than 2 and not more than 128 lines
    are used in order to stay within the suggested minimum parameter
    support range specified in annex A of the standard).

  - All optional parts of the JBIG algorithm are activated (TPBON,
    TPDON and DPON).

  - The default resolution reduction table and the default deterministic
    prediction table are used

  - The maximal vertical offset of the adaptive template pixel is 0
    and the maximal horizontal offset is 8 (mx = 8, my = 0).

In order to change any of these default parameters, additional
functions have to be called between jbg_enc_init() and jbg_enc_out().

In order to activate progressive encoding, it is possible to specify
with 

  void jbg_enc_layers(struct jbg_enc_state *s, int d);

the number d of differential resolution layers which shall be encoded
in addition to the lowest resolution layer 0. For example, if a
document with 60-micrometer pixels has to be stored, and the lowest
resolution layer shall have 240-micrometer pixels, so that a screen
previewer can directly decompress only the required resolution, then a
call

  jbg_enc_layers(&se, 2);

will cause three layers with 240, 120 and 60 micrometers resolution to
be generated.

If the application does not know what typical resolutions are used and
simply wants to ensure that the lowest resolution layer will fit into
a given maximal window size, then as an alternative, a call to

  int jbg_enc_lrlmax(struct jbg_enc_state *s, unsigned long mwidth,
                     unsigned long mheight);

will cause the library to automatically determine the suitable number
of resolutions so that the lowest resolution layer 0 will not be
larger than mwidth x mheight pixels. E.g. if one wants to ensure that
systems with a 640 x 480 pixel large screen can decode the required
resolution directly, then call

  jbg_enc_lrlmax(&se, 640, 480);

The return value is the number of differential layers selected.

After the number of resolution layers has been specified by calls to
jbg_enc_layers() or jbg_enc_lrlmax(), by default, all these layers
will be written into the BIE. This can be changed with a call to

  int  jbg_enc_lrange(struct jbg_enc_state *s, int dl, int dh);

Parameter dl specifies the lowest resolution layer and dh the highest
resolution layer that will appear in the BIE. For instance, if layer 0
shall be written to the first BIE and layer 1 and 2 shall be written
to a second one, then before writing the first BIE, call

  jbg_enc_lrange(&se, 0, 0);

and before writing the second BIE with jbg_enc_out(), call

  jbg_enc_lrange(&se, 1, 2);

If any of the parameters is negative, it will be ignored. The return
value is the total number of differential layers that will represent
the input image. This way, jbg_enc_lrange(&se, -1, -1) can be used to
query the layer of the full image resolution.

A number of other more exotic options of the JBIG algorithm can be
modified by calling

  void jbg_enc_options(struct jbg_enc_state *s, int order, int options,
                       long l0, int mx, int my);

before calling jbg_enc_out().

The order parameter can be a combination of the bits JBG_HITOLO,
JBG_SEQ, JBG_ILEAVE and JBG_SMID and it determines in which order
the SDEs are stored in the BIE. The bits have the following meaning:

  JBG_HITOLO   Usually, the lower resolution layers are stored before
               the higher resolution layers, so that a decoder can
               already start to display a low resolution version of
               the full image once a prefix of the BIE has been
               received. When this bit is set, however, the BIE will
               contain the higher layers before the lower layers. This
               avoids additional buffer memory in the encoder and is
               intended for applications where the encoder is connected
               to a database which can easily reorder the SDEs before
               sending them to a decoder. Warning: JBIG decoders are
               not expected to support the HITOLO option (e.g. the
               JBIG-KIT decoder currently does not) so you should
               normally not use it.

  JBG_SEQ      Usually, at first all stripes of one resolution layer
               are written to the BIE and then all stripes of the next
               layer, and so on. When the SEQ bit is set however, then
               all layers of the first stripe will be written,
               followed by all layers of the second stripe, etc. This
               option also should normally never be required and is
               not supported by the current JBIG-KIT decoder.

  JBG_SMID     In case there exist several bit planes, then the order of
               the stripes is determined by three loops over all stripes,
               all planes and all layers. When SMID is set, the loop
               over all stripes is the middle loop.

  JBG_ILEAVE   If this bit is set, then at first all layers of one
               plane are written before the encoder starts with the next
               plane.

The above description may be somewhat confusing, but the following
table (see also Table 11 in ITU-T T.82) clarifies how the three bits
JBG_SEQ, JBIG_ILEAVE and JBG_SMID influence the ordering of the loops
over all stripes, planes and layers:


                                                 Loops:
    JBG_SEQ   JBG_ILEAVE   JBG_SMID   |  Outer   Middle    Inner
  ------------------------------------+---------------------------
       0           0           0      |    p        d        s
       0           1           0      |    d        p        s
       0           1           1      |    d        s        p
       1           0           0      |    s        p        d
       1           0           1      |    p        s        d
       1           1           0      |    s        d        p

                                       p: plane, s: stripe, d: layer


By default, the order combination JBG_ILEAVE | JBG_SMID is used.

The options value can contain the following bits, which activate
some of the optional algorithms defined by JBIG:

  JBG_LRLTWO     Normally, in the lowest resolution layer, pixels
                 from three lines around the next pixel are used
                 in order to determine the context in which the next
                 pixel is encoded. Some people in the JBIG committee
                 seem to have argued that using only 2 lines will
                 make software implementations a little bit faster,
                 however others have argued that using only two lines
                 will decrease compression efficiency by around 5%.
                 As you might expect from a committee, now both
                 alternatives are allowed and if JBG_LRLTWO is set,
                 the slightly faster but 5% less well compressing two
                 line alternative is selected. God bless the committees.
                 Although probably nobody will ever need this option,
                 it has been implemented in JBIG-KIT and is off by
                 default.

  JBG_TPDON      This activates the "typical prediction" algorithm
                 for differential layers which avoids that large
                 areas of equal color have to be encoded at all.
                 This is on by default and there is no good reason to
                 switch it off except for debugging or preparing data
                 for cheap JBIG hardware that might not support this
                 option.

  JBG_TPBON      Like JBG_TPDON this activates the "typical prediction"
                 algorithm in the lowest resolution layer. Also activated
                 by default.

  JBG_DPON       This bit activates for the differential resolution
                 layers the "deterministic prediction" algorithm,
                 which avoids that higher resolution layer pixels are
                 encoded when their value can already be determined
                 with the knowledge of the neighbor pixels, the
                 corresponding lower resolution pixels and the
                 resolution reduction algorithm. This is also
                 activated by default and one reason for deactivating
                 it would be if the default resolution reduction
                 algorithm were replaced by another one.

  JBG_DELAY_AT   Use a slightly less efficient algorithm to determine
                 when an adaptive template change is necessary. With
                 this bit set, the encoder output is compatible to the
                 conformance test examples in cause 7.2 of ITU-T T.82.
                 Then all adaptive template changes are delayed until
                 the first line of the next stripe. This option is by
                 default deactivated and is only required for passing a
                 special compatibility test suite.

In addition, parameter l0 in jbg_enc_options() allows you to specify
the number of lines per stripe in resolution layer 0. The parameters
mx and my change the maximal offset allowed for the adaptive template
pixel. JBIG-KIT now supports the full range of possible mx values up
to 127 in the encoder and decoder, but my is at the moment ignored and
always set to 0. As the standard requires of all decoder
implementations only to support maximum values mx = 16 and my = 0,
higher values should normally be avoided in order to guarantee
interoperability. The ITU-T T.85 profile for JBIG in fax machines
requires support for mx = 127 and my = 0. Default is mx = 8 and my =
0. If any of the parameters order, options, mx or my is negative, or
l0 is zero, then the corresponding current value remains unmodified.

The resolution reduction and deterministic prediction tables can also
be replaced. However as these options are anyway only for experts,
please have a look at the source code of jbg_enc_out() and the struct
members dppriv and res_tab of struct jbg_enc_state for the details of
how to do this, in case you really need it. The functions
jbg_int2dppriv and jbg_dppriv2int are provided in order to convert the
DPTABLE data from the format used in the standard into the more
efficient format used internally by JBIG-KIT.

If you want to encode a greyscale image, you can use the library
function

  void jbg_split_planes(unsigned long x, unsigned long y, int has_planes,
                        int encode_planes,
                        const unsigned char *src, unsigned char **dest,
                        int use_graycode);

It separates an image in which each pixel is represented by one or
more bytes into separate bit planes. The dest array of pointers to
these bit planes can then be handed over to jbg_enc_init(). The
variables x and y specify the width and height of the image in pixels,
and has_planes specifies how many bits per pixel are used. As each
pixel is represented by an integral number of consecutive bytes, of
which each contains up to eight bits, the total length of the input
image array src[] will therefore be x * y * ((has_planes + 7) / 8)
bytes. The pixels are stored as usually in English reading order, and
for each pixel the integer value is stored with the most significant
byte coming first (Bigendian). This is exactly the format used in raw
PGM files. In encode_planes, the number of bit planes that shall be
extracted can be specified. This allows for instance to extract only
the most significant 8 bits of a 12-bit image, where each pixel is
represented by two bytes, by specifying has_planes = 12 and
encode_planes = 8. If use_graycode is zero, then the binary code of
the pixel integer values will be used instead of the Gray code. Plane
0 contains always the most significant bit.


3  Decompressing an image

Like with the compression functions, if you want to use the JBIG-KIT
library, you have to put the line

  #include "jbig.h"

into your source code and link your executable with libjbig.a.

The state of a JBIG decoder is stored completely in a struct and you
will have to define a variable like

  struct jbg_dec_state sd;

which is initialized by a call to

  void jbg_dec_init(struct jbg_dec_state *s);

After this, you can directly start to pass data from the BIE to the decoder
by calling the function

  int jbg_dec_in(struct jbg_dec_state *s, unsigned char *data, size_t len,
                 size_t *cnt);

The pointer data points to the first byte of a data block with length
len, which contains bytes from a BIE. It is not necessary to pass a
whole BIE at once to jbg_dec_in(), it can arrive fragmented in any way
by calling jbg_dec_in() several times. It is also possible to send
several BIEs concatenated to jbg_dec_in(), however these then have to
fit together. If you send several BIEs to the decoder, the lowest
resolution layer in each following BIE has to be the highest
resolution layer in the previous BIE plus one and the image sizes and
number of planes also have to fit together, otherwise jbg_dec_in()
will return the error JBG_ENOCONT after the header of the new BIE has
been received completely.

If pointer cnt is not NULL, then the number of bytes actually read
from the data block is stored there. In case the data block did not
contain the end of the BIE, then the value JBG_EAGAIN will be returned
and *cnt equals len.

Once the end of a BIE has been reached, the return value of
jbg_dec_in() will be JBG_EOK. After this has happened, the functions
and macros

  long jbg_dec_getwidth(struct jbg_dec_state *s);
  long jbg_dec_getheight(struct jbg_dec_state *s);
  int jbg_dec_getplanes(struct jbg_dec_state *s);
  unsigned char *jbg_dec_getimage(struct jbg_dec_state *s, int plane);
  long jbg_dec_getsize(struct jbg_dec_state *s);

can be used to query the dimensions of the now completely decoded
image and to get a pointer to all bitmap planes. The bitmaps are
stored as described in section 2.1. The function jbg_dec_getsize()
calculates the number of bytes which one bitmap requires.

The function

  void jbg_dec_merge_planes(const struct jbg_dec_state *s, int use_graycode,
                            void (*data_out)(unsigned char *start, size_t len,
                                             void *file), void *file);

allows you to merge the bit planes that can be accessed individually
with jbg_dec_getimage() into an array with one or more bytes per pixel
(i.e., the format provided to jbg_split_planes()). If use_graycode is
zero, then a binary encoding will be used. The output array will be
delivered via the callback function data_out, exactly in the same way
in which the encoder provides the BIE. The function

  long jbg_dec_getsize_merged(const struct jbg_dec_state *s);

determines how long the data array delivered by jbg_dec_merge_planes()
is going to be.

Before calling jbg_dec_in() the first time, it is possible to specify with
a call to

  void jbg_dec_maxsize(struct jbg_dec_state *s, unsigned long xmax,
                       unsigned long ymax);

an abort criterion for progressively encoded images. For instance if an
application will display a whole document on a screen which is 1024 x
768 pixels large, then this application should call

  jbg_dec_maxsize(&sd, 1024, 768);

before the decoding process starts. If the image has been encoded in
progressive mode (i.e. with several resolution layers), then the
decoder will stop with a return value JBG_EOK_INTR after the largest
resolution layer that is still smaller than 1024 x 768. However this
is no guarantee that the image which can then be read out using
jbg_dec_getimage(), etc. is really not larger than the specified
maximal size. The application will have to check the size of the
image, because the decoder does not automatically apply a resolution
reduction if no suitable resolution layer is available in the BIE.

If jbg_dec_in() returned JBG_EOK_INTR or JBG_EOK, then it is possible
to continue calling jbg_dec_in() with the remaining data in order to
either decode the remaining resolution layers of the current BIE or in
order to add another BIE with additional resolution layers. In both
cases, after jbg_dec_in() returned JBG_EOK_INTR or JBG_EOK, *cnt is
probably not equal to len and the remainder of the data block which
has not yet been processed by the decoder has to be delivered to
jbg_dec_in() again.

If any other return value than JBG_EOK, JBG_EOK_INTR or JBG_EAGAIN
has been returned by jbg_dec_in(), then an error has occurred and

  void jbg_dec_free(struct jbg_dec_state *s);

should be called in order to release any allocated memory. The
destructor jbg_dec_free() should of course also be called, once the
decoded bitmap returned by jbg_dec_getimage() is no longer required
and the memory can be released.

The function

  const char *jbg_strerror(int errnum, int language);

returns a pointer to a short single line test message which explains
the return value of jbg_dec_in(). This message can be used in order to
provide the user a brief informative message about what when wrong
while decompressing the JBIG image. The error messages are available
in several languages and in several character sets. Currently
supported are the following values for the language parameter:

  JBG_EN              English messages in ASCII
  JBG_DE_8859_1       German messages in ISO 8859-1 Latin 1 character set
  JBG_DE_UTF_8        German messages in ISO 10646/Unicode UTF-8 encoding


The current implementation of the JBIG-KIT decoder has the following
limitations:

  - The maximal vertical offset MY of the adaptive template pixel
    must be zero.

  - HITOLO and SEQ bits must not be set in the order value.

  - Not more than JBG_ATMOVES_MAX (currently set to 64) ATMOVE
    marker segments can be handled per stripe.

  - the number D of differential layers must be less than 32

None of the above limitations can be exceeded by a JBIG data stream
that conforms to the ITU-T T.85 application profile for the use of
JBIG1 in fax machines.

There are two more limitations of the current implementation of the
JBIG-KIT decoder that might cause problems with processing JBIG data
stream that conform to ITU-T T.85:

  - The JBIG-KIT decoder was designed to operate incrementally.
    Each received byte is processed immediately as soon as it arrives.
    As a result, it does not look beyond the SDRST/SDNORM at the end
    of all stripes for any immediately following NEWLEN marker that
    might reduce the number of lines encoded by the current stripe.
    However section 6.2.6.2 of ITU-T T.82 says that a NEWLEN marker
    segment "could refer to a line in the immediately preceding stripe
    due to an unexpected termination of the image or the use of only
    such stripe", and ITU-T.85 explicitly suggests the use of this
    for fax machines that start transmission before having encountered
    the end of the page.

  - The image size initially indicated in the BIE header is used to
    allocate memory for a bitmap of this size. This means that BIEs
    that set initially Y_D = 0xffffffff (as suggested in ITU-T T.85
    for fax machines that do not know the height of the page at the
    start of the transmission) cannot be decoded directly by this
    version.

For both issues, there is a very simple workaround:

If you encounter a BIE that has in the header the VLENGTH=1 option bit
set, then first wait until you have received the entire BIE and stored
it in memory. Then call the function

  int jbg_newlen(unsigned char *bie, size_t len);

where bie is a pointer to the first byte of the BIE and len its length
in bytes. This function will scan the entire BIE for the first NEWLEN
marker segment. It will then take the updated image-height value YD
from it and use it to overwrite the YD value in the BIE header. The
jbg_newlen() can return some of the same error codes as jbg_dec_in(),
namely JBG_EOK if everything went fine, JBG_EAGAIN is the data
provided is too short to be a valid BIE, JBG_EINVAL if a format error
was encountered, and JBG_EABORT if an ABORT marker segment was found.
After having patched the image-height value in the BIE using
jbg_newlen(), simply hand over the BIE as usual to jbg_dec_in().
