===============================================================================

Version 0.15.1 (beta)

  * Updated to autoconf 2.59, automake 1.8.2, libtool 1.5.2.

  * Fixed a potential problem in file.c when writing empty ID3v2 tags.

  * Added new id3_field_gettextencoding() API routine.

Version 0.15.0 (beta)

  * Updated to autoconf 2.57, automake 1.7.5, libtool 1.4.3.

  * Added new id3_tag_version(), id3_tag_options(), id3_tag_setlength(),
    id3_frame_field(), id3_field_getlatin1(), id3_field_getfulllatin1(),
    id3_genre_index(), id3_genre_number(), id3_latin1_ucs4duplicate(),
    id3_utf16_ucs4duplicate(), and id3_utf8_ucs4duplicate() API routines.

  * Properly exposed the id3_frame_new(), id3_frame_delete(), and
    id3_field_type() API routines.

  * Fixed a possible segmentation fault rendering ID3v1 tags when a tag
    field exceeds the field length limit.

  * Fixed a problem whereby the file interface could try to seek and read
    data from a non-seekable stream, unrecoverably losing data from the
    stream. (N.B. the fix does not work under Win32.)

  * Fixed a problem reading ID3v2.2 frames which corrupted their frame IDs
    and caused them not to be re-rendered.

  * Improved rendering of the ID3v1 genre field from ID3v2 genre
    names/numbers. The genre "Other" is used in place of non-translatable
    genres.

  * Rendering an empty ID3v1 tag now properly returns 0 length even when a
    null buffer pointer is passed.

  * Changed the file implementation to maintain information about present
    but unparseable tags, instead of ignoring all tags and returning an
    error.

  * Added an external dependency on zlib (libz), which is no longer
    included.

  * Changed to build a shared library by default.

  * Changed to use native Cygwin build by default; give --host=mingw32 to
    `configure' to use MinGW (and avoid a dependency on the Cygwin DLL).

Version 0.14.2 (beta)

  * Changed Cygwin builds to use MinGW; resulting Win32 executables no
    longer have a dependency on Cygwin DLLs.

Version 0.14.1 (beta)

  * Updated config.guess and config.sub to latest upstream versions.

  * Enabled libtool versioning rather than release numbering.

  * Renamed `libid3' to `libid3tag' and enabled installation as a separate
    library.

  * Several other small fixes.

Version 0.14.0 (beta)

  * Added a new ID3 tag manipulation library (libid3). The required zlib
    support is provided either by the host system or by the included static
    library implementation (libz).

  * Improved MSVC++ portability and added MSVC++ project files.
