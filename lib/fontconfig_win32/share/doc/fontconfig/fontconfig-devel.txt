DESCRIPTION

Fontconfig is a library designed to provide system-wide font configuration,
customization and application access.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

FUNCTIONAL OVERVIEW

Fontconfig contains two essential modules, the configuration module which
builds an internal configuration from XML files and the matching module which
accepts font patterns and returns the nearest matching font.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

FONT CONFIGURATION

The configuration module consists of the FcConfig datatype, libexpat and
FcConfigParse which walks over an XML tree and ammends a configuration with
data found within. From an external perspective, configuration of the library
consists of generating a valid XML tree and feeding that to FcConfigParse. The
only other mechanism provided to applications for changing the running
configuration is to add fonts and directories to the list of
application-provided font files.

The intent is to make font configurations relatively static, and shared by as
many applications as possible. It is hoped that this will lead to more stable
font selection when passing names from one application to another. XML was
chosen as a configuration file format because it provides a format which is
easy for external agents to edit while retaining the correct structure and
syntax.

Font configuration is separate from font matching; applications needing to do
their own matching can access the available fonts from the library and perform
private matching. The intent is to permit applications to pick and choose
appropriate functionality from the library instead of forcing them to choose
between this library and a private configuration mechanism. The hope is that
this will ensure that configuration of fonts for all applications can be
centralized in one place. Centralizing font configuration will simplify and
regularize font installation and customization.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

FONT PROPERTIES

While font patterns may contain essentially any properties, there are some well
known properties with associated types. Fontconfig uses some of these
properties for font matching and font completion. Others are provided as a
convenience for the applications rendering mechanism.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Datatypes

Fontconfig uses abstract datatypes to hide internal implementation details for
most data structures. A few structures are exposed where appropriate.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

FcChar8, FcChar16, FcChar32, FcBool

These are primitive datatypes; the FcChar* types hold precisely the number of
bits stated (if supported by the C implementation). FcBool holds one of two CPP
symbols: FcFalse or FcTrue.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

FcMatrix

An FcMatrix holds an affine transformation, usually used to reshape glyphs. A
small set of matrix operations are provided to manipulate these.

        typedef struct _FcMatrix {
                double xx, xy, yx, yy;
        } FcMatrix;


━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

FcCharSet

An FcCharSet is an abstract type that holds the set of encoded unicode chars in
a font. Operations to build and compare these sets are provided.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

FcLangSet

An FcLangSet is an abstract type that holds the set of languages supported by a
font. Operations to build and compare these sets are provided. These are
computed for a font based on orthographic information built into the fontconfig
library. Fontconfig has orthographies for all of the ISO 639-1 languages except
for MS, NA, PA, PS, QU, RN, RW, SD, SG, SN, SU and ZA. If you have orthographic
information for any of these languages, please submit them.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

FcLangResult

An FcLangResult is an enumeration used to return the results of comparing two
language strings or FcLangSet objects. FcLangEqual means the objects match
language and territory. FcLangDifferentTerritory means the objects match in
language but differ in territory. FcLangDifferentLang means the objects differ
in language.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

FcType

Tags the kind of data stored in an FcValue.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

FcValue

An FcValue object holds a single value with one of a number of different types.
The 'type' tag indicates which member is valid.

        typedef struct _FcValue {
                FcType type;
                union {
                        const FcChar8 *s;
                        int i;
                        FcBool b;
                        double d;
                        const FcMatrix *m;
                        const FcCharSet *c;
                        void *f;
                        const FcLangSet *l;
                } u;
        } FcValue;


                  FcValue Members

        Type            Union member    Datatype
        --------------------------------
        FcTypeVoid      (none)          (none)
        FcTypeInteger   i               int
        FcTypeDouble    d               double
        FcTypeString    s               FcChar8 *
        FcTypeBool      b               b
        FcTypeMatrix    m               FcMatrix *
        FcTypeCharSet   c               FcCharSet *
        FcTypeFTFace    f               void * (FT_Face)
        FcTypeLangSet   l               FcLangSet *


━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

FcPattern

holds a set of names with associated value lists; each name refers to a
property of a font. FcPatterns are used as inputs to the matching code as well
as holding information about specific fonts. Each property can hold one or more
values; conventionally all of the same type, although the interface doesn't
demand that.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

FcFontSet

        typedef struct _FcFontSet {
                int nfont;
                int sfont;
                FcPattern **fonts;
        } FcFontSet;


An FcFontSet contains a list of FcPatterns. Internally fontconfig uses this
data structure to hold sets of fonts. Externally, fontconfig returns the
results of listing fonts in this format. 'nfont' holds the number of patterns
in the 'fonts' array; 'sfont' is used to indicate the size of that array.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

FcStrSet, FcStrList

FcStrSet holds a list of strings that can be appended to and enumerated. Its
unique characteristic is that the enumeration works even while strings are
appended during enumeration. FcStrList is used during enumeration to safely and
correctly walk the list of strings even while that list is edited in the middle
of enumeration.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

FcObjectSet

        typedef struct _FcObjectSet {
                int nobject;
                int sobject;
                const char **objects;
        } FcObjectSet;


holds a set of names and is used to specify which fields from fonts are placed
in the the list of returned patterns when listing fonts.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

FcObjectType

        typedef struct _FcObjectType {
                const char *object;
                FcType type;
        } FcObjectType;


marks the type of a pattern element generated when parsing font names.
Applications can add new object types so that font names may contain the new
elements.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

FcConstant

        typedef struct _FcConstant {
            const FcChar8 *name;
            const char *object;
            int value;
        } FcConstant;


Provides for symbolic constants for new pattern elements. When 'name' is seen
in a font name, an 'object' element is created with value 'value'.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

FcBlanks

holds a list of Unicode chars which are expected to be blank; unexpectedly
blank chars are assumed to be invalid and are elided from the charset
associated with the font.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

FcFileCache

holds the per-user cache information for use while loading the font database.
This is built automatically for the current configuration when that is loaded.
Applications must always pass '0' when one is requested.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

FcConfig

holds a complete configuration of the library; there is one default
configuration, other can be constructed from XML data structures. All public
entry points that need global data can take an optional FcConfig* argument;
passing 0 uses the default configuration. FcConfig objects hold two sets of
fonts, the first contains those specified by the configuration, the second set
holds those added by the application at run-time. Interfaces that need to
reference a particulat set use one of the FcSetName enumerated values.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

FcSetName

Specifies one of the two sets of fonts available in a configuration;
FcSetSystem for those fonts specified in the configuration and FcSetApplication
which holds fonts provided by the application.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

FcResult

Used as a return type for functions manipulating FcPattern objects.

      FcResult Values
        Result Code             Meaning
        -----------------------------------------------------------
        FcResultMatch           Object exists with the specified ID
        FcResultNoMatch         Object doesn't exist at all
        FcResultTypeMismatch    Object exists, but the type doesn't match
        FcResultNoId            Object exists, but has fewer values
                                than specified
        FcResultOutOfMemory     Malloc failed


━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

FcAtomic

Used for locking access to config files. Provides a safe way to update
configuration files.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

FcCache

Holds information about the fonts contained in a single directory. Normal
applications need not worry about this as caches for font access are
automatically managed by the library. Applications dealing with cache
management may want to use some of these objects in their work, however the
included 'fc-cache' program generally suffices for all of that.

FcPatternBuild

Name

FcPatternBuild, FcPatternVaBuild, FcPatternVapBuild -- Create patterns from
arguments

Synopsis

#include <fontconfig.h>


FcPattern * FcPatternBuild(FcPattern *pattern, ...);

FcPattern * FcPatternVaBuild(FcPattern *pattern, va_list va);

void FcPatternVapBuild(FcPattern *result, FcPattern *pattern, va_list va);

Description

Builds a pattern using a list of objects, types and values. Each value to be
entered in the pattern is specified with three arguments:

 1. Object name, a string describing the property to be added.

 2. Object type, one of the FcType enumerated values

 3. Value, not an FcValue, but the raw type as passed to any of the
    FcPatternAdd<type> functions. Must match the type of the second argument.

The argument list is terminated by a null object name, no object type nor value
need be passed for this. The values are added to `pattern', if `pattern' is
null, a new pattern is created. In either case, the pattern is returned.
Example

pattern = FcPatternBuild (0, FC_FAMILY, FcTypeString, "Times", (char *) 0);

FcPatternVaBuild is used when the arguments are already in the form of a
varargs value. FcPatternVapBuild is a macro version of FcPatternVaBuild which
returns its result directly in the result variable.

Version

Fontconfig version 2.7.3

FcPatternFormat

Name

FcPatternFormat -- Format a pattern into a string according to a format
specifier

Synopsis

#include <fontconfig.h>


FcChar8 * FcPatternFormat(FcPattern *pat, const FcChar8 *format);

Description

Converts given pattern pat into text described by the format specifier format.
The return value refers to newly allocated memory which should be freed by the
caller using free(), or NULL if format is invalid. 

 The format is loosely modelled after printf-style format string. The format
string is composed of zero or more directives: ordinary characters (not "%"),
which are copied unchanged to the output stream; and tags which are interpreted
to construct text from the pattern in a variety of ways (explained below).
Special characters can be escaped using backslash. C-string style special
characters like \n and \r are also supported (this is useful when the format
string is not a C string literal). It is advisable to always escape curly
braces that are meant to be copied to the output as ordinary characters. 

 Each tags is introduced by the character "%", followed by an optional minimum
field width, followed by tag contents in curly braces ({}). If the minimum
field width value is provided the tag will be expanded and the result padded to
achieve the minimum width. If the minimum field width is positive, the padding
will right-align the text. Negative field width will left-align. The rest of
this section describes various supported tag contents and their expansion. 

 A simple tag is one where the content is an identifier. When simple tags are
expanded, the named identifier will be looked up in pattern and the resulting
list of values returned, joined together using comma. For example, to print the
family name and style the pattern, use the format "%{family} %{style}\n". To
extend the family column to forty characters use "%-40{family}%{style}\n". 

 Simple tags expand to list of all values for an element. To only choose one of
the values, one can index using the syntax "%{elt[idx]}". For example, to get
the first family name only, use "%{family[0]}". 

 If a simple tag ends with "=" and the element is found in the pattern, the
name of the element followed by "=" will be output before the list of values.
For example, "%{weight=}" may expand to the string "weight=80". Or to the empty
string if pattern does not have weight set. 

 If a simple tag starts with ":" and the element is found in the pattern, ":"
will be printed first. For example, combining this with the =, the format "%
{:weight=}" may expand to ":weight=80" or to the empty string if pattern does
not have weight set. 

 If a simple tag contains the string ":-", the rest of the the tag contents
will be used as a default string. The default string is output if the element
is not found in the pattern. For example, the format "%{:weight=:-123}" may
expand to ":weight=80" or to the string ":weight=123" if pattern does not have
weight set. 

 A count tag is one that starts with the character "#" followed by an element
name, and expands to the number of values for the element in the pattern. For
example, "%{#family}" expands to the number of family names pattern has set,
which may be zero. 

 A sub-expression tag is one that expands a sub-expression. The tag contents
are the sub-expression to expand placed inside another set of curly braces.
Sub-expression tags are useful for aligning an entire sub-expression, or to
apply converters (explained later) on an entire sub-expression. For example,
the format "%40{{%{family} %{style}}}" expands the sub-expression to construct
the family name followed by the style, then takes the entire string and pads it
on the left to be at least forty characters. 

 A filter-out tag is one starting with the character "-" followed by a
comma-separated list of element names, followed by a sub-expression enclosed in
curly braces. The sub-expression will be expanded but with a pattern that has
the listed elements removed from it. For example, the format "%{-size,pixelsize
{sub-expr}}" will expand "sub-expr" with pattern sans the size and pixelsize
elements. 

 A filter-in tag is one starting with the character "+" followed by a
comma-separated list of element names, followed by a sub-expression enclosed in
curly braces. The sub-expression will be expanded but with a pattern that only
has the listed elements from the surrounding pattern. For example, the format
"%{+family,familylang{sub-expr}}" will expand "sub-expr" with a sub-pattern
consisting only the family and family lang elements of pattern. 

 A conditional tag is one starting with the character "?" followed by a
comma-separated list of element conditions, followed by two sub-expression
enclosed in curly braces. An element condition can be an element name, in which
case it tests whether the element is defined in pattern, or the character "!"
followed by an element name, in which case the test is negated. The conditional
passes if all the element conditions pass. The tag expands the first
sub-expression if the conditional passes, and expands the second sub-expression
otherwise. For example, the format "%{?size,dpi,!pixelsize{pass}{fail}}" will
expand to "pass" if pattern has size and dpi elements but no pixelsize element,
and to "fail" otherwise. 

 An enumerate tag is one starting with the string "[]" followed by a
comma-separated list of element names, followed by a sub-expression enclosed in
curly braces. The list of values for the named elements are walked in parallel
and the sub-expression expanded each time with a pattern just having a single
value for those elements, starting from the first value and continuing as long
as any of those elements has a value. For example, the format "%{[]
family,familylang{%{family} (%{familylang})\n}}" will expand the pattern "%
{family} (%{familylang})\n" with a pattern having only the first value of the
family and familylang elemtns, then expands it with the second values, then the
third, etc. 

 As a special case, if an enumerate tag has only one element, and that element
has only one value in the pattern, and that value is of type FcLangSet, the
individual languages in the language set are enumerated. 

 A builtin tag is one starting with the character "=" followed by a builtin
name. The following builtins are defined:

unparse

    Expands to the result of calling FcNameUnparse() on the pattern.

fcmatch

    Expands to the output of the default output format of the fc-match command
    on the pattern, without the final newline.

fclist

    Expands to the output of the default output format of the fc-list command
    on the pattern, without the final newline.

pkgkit

    Expands to the list of PackageKit font() tags for the pattern. Currently
    this includes tags for each family name, and each language from the
    pattern, enumerated and sanitized into a set of tags terminated by newline.
    Package management systems can use these tags to tag their packages
    accordingly.

For example, the format "%{+family,style{%{=unparse}}}\n" will expand to an
unparsed name containing only the family and style element values from pattern.
 

 The contents of any tag can be followed by a set of zero or more converters. A
converter is specified by the character "|" followed by the converter name and
arguments. The following converters are defined:

basename

    Replaces text with the results of calling FcStrBasename() on it.

dirname

    Replaces text with the results of calling FcStrDirname() on it.

downcase

    Replaces text with the results of calling FcStrDowncase() on it.

shescape

    Escapes text for one level of shell expansion. (Escapes single-quotes, also
    encloses text in single-quotes.)

cescape

    Escapes text such that it can be used as part of a C string literal.
    (Escapes backslash and double-quotes.)

xmlescape

    Escapes text such that it can be used in XML and HTML. (Escapes less-than,
    greater-than, and ampersand.)

delete(chars)

    Deletes all occurrences of each of the characters in chars from the text.
    FIXME: This converter is not UTF-8 aware yet.

escape(chars)

    Escapes all occurrences of each of the characters in chars by prepending it
    by the first character in chars. FIXME: This converter is not UTF-8 aware
    yet.

translate(from,to)

    Translates all occurrences of each of the characters in from by replacing
    them with their corresponding character in to. If to has fewer characters
    than from, it will be extended by repeating its last character. FIXME: This
    converter is not UTF-8 aware yet.

For example, the format "%{family|downcase|delete( )}\n" will expand to the
values of the family element in pattern, lower-cased and with spaces removed.

File and Directory routines

Table of Contents
FcFileScan -- scan a font file
FcFileIsDir -- check whether a file is a directory
FcDirScan -- scan a font directory without caching it
FcDirSave -- DEPRECATED: formerly used to save a directory cache
FcDirCacheUnlink -- Remove all caches related to dir
FcDirCacheValid -- check directory cache
FcDirCacheLoad -- load a directory cache
FcDirCacheRead -- read or construct a directory cache
FcDirCacheLoadFile -- load a cache file
FcDirCacheUnload -- unload a cache file

These routines work with font files and directories, including font directory
cache files.

FcFileScan

Name

FcFileScan -- scan a font file

Synopsis

#include <fontconfig.h>


FcBool FcFileScan(FcFontSet *set, FcStrSet *dirs, FcFileCache *cache, FcBlanks
*blanks, const FcChar8 *file, FcBool force);

Description

Scans a single file and adds all fonts found to set. If force is FcTrue, then
the file is scanned even if associated information is found in cache. If file
is a directory, it is added to dirs. Whether fonts are found depends on
fontconfig policy as well as the current configuration. Internally, fontconfig
will ignore BDF and PCF fonts which are not in Unicode (or the effectively
equivalent ISO Latin-1) encoding as those are not usable by Unicode-based
applications. The configuration can ignore fonts based on filename or contents
of the font file itself. Returns FcFalse if any of the fonts cannot be added
(due to allocation failure). Otherwise returns FcTrue.

Version

Fontconfig version 2.7.3

blanks, const FcChar8 *dir, FcBool force);

Description

If cache is not zero or if force is FcFalse, this function currently returns
FcFalse. Otherwise, it scans an entire directory and adds all fonts found to
set. Any subdirectories found are added to dirs. Calling this function does not
create any cache files. Use FcDirCacheRead() if caching is desired.

Version

Fontconfig version 2.7.3

FcDirSave

Name

FcDirSave -- DEPRECATED: formerly used to save a directory cache

Synopsis

#include <fontconfig.h>


FcBool FcDirSave(FcFontSet *set, FcStrSet *dirs, const FcChar8 *dir);

Description

This function now does nothing aside from returning FcFalse. It used to creates
the per-directory cache file for dir and populates it with the fonts in set and
subdirectories in dirs. All of this functionality is now automatically managed
by FcDirCacheLoad and FcDirCacheRead.
