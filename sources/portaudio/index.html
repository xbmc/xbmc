<p>PortAudio is a cross platform, <a href="#License">open-source</a>, audio
I/O library proposed by <b>Ross Bencina</b> to the <a href="http://shoko.calarts.edu/~glmrboy/musicdsp/music-dsp.html">music-dsp</a>
mailing list. It lets you write simple audio programs in 'C' that will
compile and run on <b>Windows, Macintosh, Unix, BeOS</b>. PortAudio is
intended to promote the exchange of audio synthesis software between developers
on different platforms.
