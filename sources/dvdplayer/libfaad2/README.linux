about the xmms plugin.
---------------------
 The xmms plugin need to be build after the install of the faad project.
so after you have installed correctly faad (--with-xmms options) you need
to configure and build the xmms plugin part in the plugins/xmms directory.
Read the README and INSTALL files into the xmms directory.
