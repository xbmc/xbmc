1. Introduction
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a platform port of Kodi for the Apple OSX operating system. 10.9 and 10.10 Intel development 
platforms are supported. Xcode 6 newer are the recommended versions.
There are 3 ways to build Kodi for Mac, from command-line with make, from command-line
using xcodebuild or from Xcode.

The minimum version of OSX you need to run(!) Kodi is 10.7 atm.

Generally, Xcode is the easiest as it presents the build system in a GUI environment.
The command-line build is still under development.

Kodi for Mac is composed of a main binary with numerous dynamic libraries and
codecs that support a multitude of music and video formats.

On Mavericks (OSX 10.9.x) we recommend using Xcode 6.1.
On Yosemite (OSX 10.10.x) we recommend using Xcode 6.1.

NOTE TO NEW OS X USERS: All lines that are prefixed with the '$' character are
commands that need to be typed into a Terminal window. Note that the '$'
character itself should NOT be typed as part of the command.

ATTENTION: You need to download and install XQuartz from https://xquartz.macosforge.org/landing/ since 
its not part of OSX anymore since 10.8.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. Getting the source code
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

 $ cd $HOME
 $ git clone git://github.com/xbmc/xbmc.git Kodi

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.1 Install XCODE
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
See point 3.1.1 below for an updated list of supported/tested Xcode/osx constellations!!!

Install latest Xcode (6.1.0 ). You can download it from the MacOSX AppStore (Xcode). 

Xcode 6.1 runs on 10.9.5 and later (at least Mavericks).

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.1.1 Supported Xcode and OSX constellations
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
As far as we know the compilation for mac osx should work with the following
constellations of Xcode and osx versions (to be updated once we know more):
 
1. XCode 6.0.1 against OSX SDK 10.9 (M)
2. XCode 6.1.0 against OSX SDK 10.10 (Y)
3. XCode 6.2.0 against OSX SDK 10.10 (Y)
4. XCode 6.3.0 against OSX SDK 10.10 (Y)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.2 Install Kodi build depends
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 The following commands will build using the latest OSX SDK found on your
 system.

3.2.1 Compiling as 32 Bit binary
 $ cd $HOME/Kodi
 $ cd tools/depends
 $ ./bootstrap
 $ ./configure --host=i386-apple-darwin
 $ make

3.2.2 Compiling as 64 Bit binary
 $ cd $HOME/Kodi
 $ cd tools/depends
 $ ./bootstrap
 $ ./configure --host=x86_64-apple-darwin
 $ make

3.2.3 Compile binary addons
 $ make -C target/binary-addons

 NOTE: if you only want to build specific addons you can specify like this:
  $ make -C target/binary-addons ADDONS="pvr.hts pvr.dvblink"

 NOTE: You can speedup compilation on multicore systems by doing
 "make -j<number of cores>" instead of "make". For a dualcore this would read:
 "make -j2"

 ADVANCED developers only! If you want to specify an OSX SDK version (if
 multiple versions are installed) - then append it to the configure line
 above (example below would use OSX SDK 10.9 and build for 64bit):

 $ ./configure --host=x86_64-apple-darwin --with-sdk=10.9

 Ensure that you also adapt the xcode project to use this SDK version.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
4. How to compile
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Both Xcode and Terminal compilation require that build environment be setup
first. This is a simple step and involves the following:

4.a Compilation by using command-line building via xcodebuild or
    by compiling via Xcode GUI

 $ cd $HOME/Kodi
 $ make -C tools/depends/target/xbmc
 $ make clean
 $ make xcode_depends

4.b Compilation by using command-line building via make (experimental)

 $ cd $HOME/Kodi
 $ make -C tools/depends/target/xbmc
 $ make clean

The configure operation will setup the build environment for codecs and
internal libraries that are used by Kodi. This step is required for both Xcode
and command-line building. The "make clean" ensures that there are no stale
binaries from git that might cause problems.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.1 Using Xcode
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Start XCode and open the Kodi project (Kodi.xcodeproj) located in $HOME/Kodi.
For development, Kodi is run from the $HOME/Kodi directory and needs to have
the KODI_HOME environment variable set to know where that directory is located.
To set KODI_HOME environment variable:

Xcode 6 and later
 Menu -> Product -> Edit Sheme -> "Run Kodi"/"Debug" -> Add KODI_HOME into
 the List of "Environment Variables". Set the value to the path to the Kodi
 root folder. For example, "/Users/bigdog/Documents/Kodi"	

There are two build targets "Kodi" and "Kodi.app" (each in 32Bit and 64Bit flavour) 
with debug and release settings. The "Kodi" target is used for rapid build and 
debug cycles while the "Kodi.app" target is used to build a self contained 
OSX application bundle.

Set the build target to "Kodi" or "Kodi.app" and be sure to select the same 
architecture as selected in step 3.2 (either i386 for 32Bit or x86_64 for 64Bit), 
then build. 

If you have selected a specific OSX SDK Version in step 3.2 then you might need 
to adapt the active target to use the same OSX SDK version. Else build will fail 
(you will see alot of errors with at least non-found boost/shared_ptr.hpp).

The build process will take a long time when building the first time. 
You can see the progress in "Build Results". There are a large number of static 
and dynamic libaries that will need to be built. Once these are built, 
subsequent builds will be faster.

After the build, you can ether run Kodi for Mac from Xcode or run it from
the command-line. If you run it from the command-line, make sure your set
the KODI_HOME environment variable (export KODI_HOME=$HOME/Kodi). Then, to
run the debug version:

$ ./build/Debug/Kodi

Or the release version:

$ ./build/Release/Kodi

You can also build via Xcode from the command-line using the following:

$ xcodebuild -configuration Release ONLY_ACTIVE_ARCH=YES ARCHS=i386 VALID_ARCHS=i386 \
  -target "Kodi.app" -project Kodi.xcodeproj

You can specify "Release" instead of "Debug" as a configuration. Be sure to set *_ARCHS
variables to the same architecture as selected in step 3.2 (either i386 for 32Bit or x86_64 
for 64Bit).

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.2 Using Terminal (command-line) (this is a work in progress and might fail)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
There are two methods, a) make/Xcode and b) make (which might fail as it's under
construction).

You could try xcodebuild from the command-line with altered SDK - like 10.9 in the example
below(normally unneeded - for advanced developers).

 a)
 $ cd $HOME/Kodi
 $ export KODI_HOME=`pwd`
 $ make xcode_depends
 $ xcodebuild -sdk macosx10.9 -project Kodi.xcodeproj -target Kodi.app ONLY_ACTIVE_ARCH=YES \
   ARCHS=x86_64 VALID_ARCHS=x86_64  -configuration Release build

 b) building via make
 $ cd $HOME/Kodi
 $ export KODI_HOME=`pwd`
 $ make
 $ ./Kodi.bin

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
5. Packaging
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
This section describes how to package Kodi in a disk image for
distribution.

  1. build Kodi.app from XCode so that the application bundle is correctly updated.

  2. $ cd tools/darwin/packaging/osx

  3. $ chmod +x ./mkdeb-osx.sh && ./mkdmg-osx.sh release

  4. Use release or debug - you have to be sure that you build the corresponding
     version before.

  6. Find the corresponding dmg in the packaging dir.
