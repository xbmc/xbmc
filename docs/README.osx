1. Introduction
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a platform port of XBMC for the Apple OSX operating system. 10.6, 10.7
and 10.8 Intel development platforms are supported. Xcode 3.2.6 and 4.3 and newer
are the recommended versions.
There are 3 ways to build XBMC for Mac, from command-line with make, from command-line
using xcodebuild or from Xcode.

Generally, Xcode is the easiest as it presents the build system in a GUI environment.
The command-line build is still under development.

XBMC for Mac is composed of a main binary with numerous dynamic libraries and
codecs that support a multitude of music and video formats.

On Snow Leopard (OSX 10.6.x) we recommend using Xcode 3.2.6.
On Lion (OSX 10.7.x) we recommend using Xcode 4.3.x.
On Mountain Lion (OSX 10.8.1) we recommend using Xcode 4.4.

NOTE TO NEW OS X USERS: All lines that are prefixed with the '$' character are
commands that need to be typed into a Terminal window. Note that the '$'
character itself should NOT be typed as part of the command.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. Getting the source code
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

 $ cd $HOME
 $ git clone git://github.com/xbmc/xbmc.git xbmc

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.0 Install XCODE
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Install latest Xcode (4.3.2 or 3.2.6 as of the writing). You can download it from 

1. Apple's site after registration at http://developer.apple.com/tools/download (Xcode 3.2.6)
2. In the MacOSX AppStore (Xcode 4.3.x). 

If you are using XCode 4.3.x or later you also need to install the "Command Line Tools". To do so
after installing Xcode you have to go to "Xcode->Preferences->Downloads" and install the
package "Command Line Tools".

Xcode 3.2.6 only runs on 10.6.x (Snow Leopard). 
Xcode 4.3.x only runs on 10.7.x (Lion).
Xcode 4.4 only runs on 10.8.x (Mountain Lion).

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.1 Install XBMC build depends
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

3.1.1 Compiling as 32 Bit binary
 $ cd $HOME/XBMC
 $ cd tools/darwin/depends
 $ ./bootstrap
 $ ./configure --with-darwin=osx
 $ make

3.1.2 Compiling as 64 Bit binary
 $ cd $HOME/XBMC
 $ cd tools/darwin/depends
 $ ./bootstrap
 $ ./configure --with-darwin=osx --with-arch=x86_64
 $ make

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
4. How to compile
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Both Xcode and Terminal compilation require that build environment be setup
first. This is a simple step and involves the following:

4.a Compilation by using command-line building via xcodebuild or
    by compiling via Xcode GUI

 $ cd $HOME/XBMC
 $ make -C tools/darwin/depends/xbmc
 $ make clean
 $ make xcode_depends
 $ make -C lib/addons/script.module.pil

4.b Compilation by using command-line building via make (experimental)

 $ cd $HOME/XBMC
 $ make -C tools/darwin/depends/xbmc
 $ make clean

The configure operation will setup the build environment for codecs and
internal libraries that are used by XBMC. This step is required for both Xcode
and command-line building. The "make clean" ensures that there are no stale
binaries from git that might cause problems.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.1 Using Xcode
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Start XCode and open the XBMC project (XBMC.xcodeproj) located in $HOME/XBMC.
For development, XBMC is run from the $HOME/XBMC directory and needs to have
the XBMC_HOME environment variable set to know where that directory is located.
To set XBMC_HOME environment variable:

Xcode 3.2.6
 Menu -> Project -> Edit Active Executable "XBMC", click "Arguments" tab and
 add "XBMC_HOME" as an enviroment variable. Set the value to the path to the
 XBMC root folder. For example, "/Users/bigdog/Documents/XBMC"

Xcode 4.3.x and later
 Menu -> Product -> Edit Sheme -> "Run XBMC"/"Debug" -> Add XBMC_HOME into 
 the List of "Environment Variables".Set the value to the path to thev XBMC 
 root folder. For example, "/Users/bigdog/Documents/XBMC"	

There are two build targets "XBMC" and "XBMC.app" (each in 32Bit and 64Bit flavour) 
with debug and release settings. The "XBMC" target is used for rapid build and 
debug cycles while the "XBMC.app" target is used to build a self contained 
OSX application.

Set the build target to "XBMC" or "XBMC.app" and be sure to select the same 
architecture as selected in step 3.1 (either i386 for 32Bit or x86_64 for 64Bit), 
then build. 

The build process will take a long time when building the first time. 
You can see the progress in "Build Results". There are a large number of static 
and dynamic libaries that will need to be built. Once these are built, 
subsequent builds will be faster.

After the build, you can ether run XBMC for Mac from Xcode or run it from
the command-line. If you run it from the command-line, make sure your set
the XBMC_HOME environment variable (export XBMC_HOME=$HOME/XBMC). Then, to
run the debug version:

$ ./build/Debug/XBMC

Or the release version:

$ ./build/Release/XBMC

You can also build via Xcode from the command-line using the following:

$ xcodebuild -configuration Release ONLY_ACTIVE_ARCH=YES ARCHS=i386 VALID_ARCHS=i386 \
  -target "XBMC.app" -project XBMC.xcodeproj

You can specify "Release" instead of "Debug" as a configuration. Be sure to set *_ARCHS
variables to the same architecture as selected in step 3.1 (either i386 for 32Bit or x86_64 
for 64Bit).

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.2 Using Terminal (command-line) (this is a work in progress and might fail)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
There are two methods, a) make/Xcode and b) make (which might fail as it's under
construction).

If you want to build a cross-compiled version that can run under 10.6/10.7, 
you could try xcodebuild from the command-line (normally unneeded - for advanced
developers).

 a)
 $ cd $HOME/XBMC
 $ export XBMC_HOME=`pwd`
 $ make xcode_depends
 $ make -C lib/addons/script.module.pil
 $ xcodebuild -sdk macosx10.7 -project XBMC.xcodeproj -target XBMC.app ONLY_ACTIVE_ARCH=YES \
   ARCHS=x86_64 VALID_ARCHS=x86_64  -configuration Release build

 b) building via make
 $ cd $HOME/XBMC
 $ export XBMC_HOME=`pwd`
 $ make
 $ ./xbmc.bin

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
5. Packaging
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
This section describes how to package XBMC in a disk image for
distribution.

  1. build XBMC.app from XCode so that the application bundle is correctly updated.

  2. make -C tools/darwin/packaging/xbmc-osx

  3. If completed successfully, a disk image named XBMC_for_Mac.dmg will be
  present in the users XBMC build directory:

Remember to unmount/eject XBMC.dmg before attempting to recreate it,
otherwise dmgmaker.pl will fail.
