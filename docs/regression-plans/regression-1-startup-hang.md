# Regression 1 — Boot Hang on Skins Using Startup.xml ReplaceWindow

**Repository:** OrganizerRo/xbmc  
**Date:** 2024  
**Severity:** Critical — complete boot deadlock; Kodi does not reach the home screen.

## 1. Root Cause Analysis

### The Deferral Bug

A PR added early-boot deferral logic to `CApplication::ExecuteXBMCAction` guarded by `m_bInitializing == true`. When a skin's `Startup.xml` `<onload>` fires `ReplaceWindow(Home)` or `ActivateWindow(Home)` during initialisation, that message is deferred instead of executed. As a result:

1. The `CGUIWindowManager` never receives the window-activate message.
2. `OnDeinitWindow` is never called on the splash/startup window.
3. `GUI_MSG_UI_READY` is therefore never dispatched to `CApplication`.
4. `CApplication::Initialize()` spins waiting for `GUI_MSG_UI_READY` → **deadlock**.

```cpp
// Application.cpp — BUGGY version
bool CApplication::ExecuteXBMCAction(std::string actionStr, const CGUIListItemPtr &item)
{
  if (m_bInitializing) {
    m_deferredActions.push_back(actionStr);  // ← defers ReplaceWindow(Home)
    return true;                             // ← splash window never deactivated
  }
  // ...
}
```

### The Boot-Ready Signal Chain

```
CApplication::Initialize()
  → CGUIWindowManager::ActivateWindow(WINDOW_STARTUP_ANIM)
  → Startup.xml <onload> runs
      → ExecuteXBMCAction("ReplaceWindow(Home)")   ← DEFERRED → hang
  → [waits for GUI_MSG_UI_READY]
       ↑ never arrives because ReplaceWindow never fires
```

The deferred queue is only flushed _after_ `m_bInitializing` is set to `false` (line 3759), but that assignment only happens _after_ `GUI_MSG_UI_READY` is received — creating a circular dependency.

## 2. Exact Call Path

```
CApplication::Initialize()
  → GUIWindowManager.ActivateWindow(WINDOW_STARTUP_ANIM)
      → CGUIWindow::OnInitWindow()
          → CGUIAction::ExecuteActions()   [Startup.xml <onload>]
              → CGUIMessage(GUI_MSG_EXECUTE, ..., "ReplaceWindow(Home)")
                  → CApplication::OnMessage()
                      → ExecuteXBMCAction("ReplaceWindow(Home)")
                          → if (m_bInitializing)        ← TRUE
                              m_deferredActions.push_back(...)  ← DEFERS
                              return true               ← boom
  → [spin-wait for GUI_MSG_UI_READY]   ← NEVER ARRIVES
```

## 3. Why Only Certain Skins Are Affected

Skins that use a `Startup.xml` with `<onload>ReplaceWindow(...)</onload>` or `ActivateWindow(...)` rely on that action completing synchronously before the init sequence continues. Skins that transition to Home via a different mechanism (e.g., a timed animation that calls `ActivateWindow` after `m_bInitializing` is already `false`) are not affected.

Known affected patterns:
- `<onload>ReplaceWindow(Home)</onload>` in `Startup.xml`
- `<onload>ActivateWindow(Home)</onload>` in `Startup.xml`
- Any `RunScript(...)` or `PlayMedia(...)` call in `Startup.xml` `<onload>` that itself depends on a window being active

## 4. Candidate Fix Approaches

### Approach A — Bypass Deferral for Window-Navigation Builtins (Recommended)

Check whether `actionStr` begins with `ActivateWindow(`, `ReplaceWindow(`, or `FullscreenWindow(`. If so, execute immediately regardless of `m_bInitializing`.

```cpp
bool CApplication::ExecuteXBMCAction(std::string actionStr, const CGUIListItemPtr &item)
{
  if (m_bInitializing)
  {
    // Window navigation is required for boot to complete — never defer.
    static const std::vector<std::string> bootCritical = {
      "ActivateWindow(", "ReplaceWindow(", "FullscreenWindow("
    };
    bool isCritical = std::any_of(bootCritical.begin(), bootCritical.end(),
      [&](const std::string& prefix){ return StringUtils::StartsWithNoCase(actionStr, prefix); });
    if (!isCritical)
    {
      m_deferredActions.push_back({actionStr, item});
      return true;
    }
    // fall through to immediate execution
  }
  // ... rest of function
}
```

**Pros:**
- Minimal, targeted change.
- Does not affect any non-window-navigation actions.
- Boot sequence completes normally.

**Cons:**
- Requires maintaining a list of "boot-critical" prefixes.
- Skin authors could invent unusual action strings that alias window navigation.

### Approach B — Never Defer `GUI_MSG_EXECUTE` from `CGUIWindow::OnInitWindow`

Pass a flag through the message chain indicating the message originates from a window's `<onload>` handler. In `ExecuteXBMCAction`, skip deferral when this flag is set.

**Pros:** Context-aware; catches all `<onload>` actions.  
**Cons:** Requires threading a flag through `CGUIMessage`, `CGUIAction`, and `CGUIWindow` — wider blast radius.

---

### Approach C — Process Deferral Queue Inline Before the `GUI_MSG_UI_READY` Wait

Before entering the spin-wait for `GUI_MSG_UI_READY`, flush the deferred queue. Repeat until `m_bInitializing` is false or max iterations reached.

**Cons:** Convoluted; the flush can itself enqueue more items; still doesn't guarantee `GUI_MSG_UI_READY` is sent.

---

## 5. Recommended Fix — Approach A

### Code Structure Context

**Important:** In the current code (without R3), `GetItemLabel`/`GetLabel` label resolution happens **before** the `m_bInitializing` deferral check. The `bootCritical` prefix check therefore runs on the **resolved** `actionStr`. This is functionally correct for window navigation builtins — `ActivateWindow(Home)`, `ReplaceWindow(Home)`, and `FullscreenWindow` never contain `$INFO` tokens, so their resolved and unresolved forms are identical.

When R3 is also applied (recommended), the label resolution block is **moved to after** the deferral check, so the `bootCritical` check runs on the **original, unresolved** action string. This is equally correct and also more robust for hypothetical future skins that might write `ActivateWindow($INFO[Window.Property(target)])` — the check catches the prefix before resolution.

### Detailed Code Changes

#### `xbmc/Application.cpp` — `ExecuteXBMCAction` (with R3 applied)

The diff below shows the full function head after both R1 and R3 are applied. The label resolution block has been moved to after the deferral check so that deferred actions preserve the unresolved string.

```diff
 bool CApplication::ExecuteXBMCAction(std::string actionStr, const CGUIListItemPtr &item)
 {
   const std::string in_actionStr(actionStr);
+
+  if (m_bInitializing)
+  {
+    // Window navigation actions must execute immediately during boot;
+    // deferring them prevents GUI_MSG_UI_READY from ever being sent.
+    static const std::array<std::string_view, 3> bootCritical = {
+        "ActivateWindow(", "ReplaceWindow(", "FullscreenWindow("
+    };
+    bool isCritical = std::any_of(bootCritical.begin(), bootCritical.end(),
+        [&](std::string_view prefix)
+        { return StringUtils::StartsWithNoCase(actionStr, std::string(prefix)); });
+    if (!isCritical)
+    {
+      m_deferredActions.push_back({actionStr, item});  // R3: store unresolved string + item
+      return false;   // R4: do not suppress peripheral key events on deferral
+    }
+    // fall through: execute boot-critical window navigation immediately
+  }
+
+  // Resolve labels here (info manager is fully ready for immediate execution
+  // and for the deferred-action flush path).
   if (item)
     actionStr = GUILIB::GUIINFO::CGUIInfoLabel::GetItemLabel(actionStr, item.get());
   else
     actionStr = GUILIB::GUIINFO::CGUIInfoLabel::GetLabel(actionStr);
-
-  if (m_bInitializing)
-  {
-    m_deferredActions.push_back(actionStr);
-    return true;
-  }
   // ... rest unchanged
```

No changes to `Application.h` are required for this fix alone (though R3 fix recommends upgrading `m_deferredActions` to `std::deque<DeferredAction>`; these two fixes compose cleanly).

## 6. Edge Cases

### 6a. `ActivateWindow` With Parameters
`ActivateWindow(MyVideoNav,/path/to/dir)` — the prefix check catches this correctly since it tests the start of the string.

### 6b. Skin Uses `RunScript` in Startup That Opens a Window
If `RunScript(script.launcher.py)` internally calls `ActivateWindow`, that call happens from within Python on a separate thread — already outside the `m_bInitializing` guard by the time the Python thread fires. Not affected.

### 6c. Alias `xbmc.activatewindow` Built-in
Some action strings arrive after lower-casing or alias expansion. `StringUtils::StartsWithNoCase` handles case variation. Aliases resolved via `CBuiltins` happen after this deferral check and so are not relevant.

### 6d. `FullscreenWindow` During PVR Startup
`FullscreenWindow` transitions to the fullscreen player. If a PVR skin fires this from `Startup.xml`, the same deadlock occurs. The fix covers this via the `FullscreenWindow(` prefix.

---

## 7. Test Scenarios

### T1 — Skin With `ReplaceWindow(Home)` in `Startup.xml`
1. Set `m_bInitializing = true`.
2. Fire `GUI_MSG_EXECUTE` with `"ReplaceWindow(Home)"`.
3. Verify action is **not** deferred — executes immediately.
4. Verify `GUI_MSG_UI_READY` is subsequently sent.
5. Verify `m_bInitializing` transitions to `false`.

### T2 — Normal Action Is Still Deferred
1. Set `m_bInitializing = true`.
2. Fire `GUI_MSG_EXECUTE` with `"PlayMedia(smb://nas/movie.mkv)"`.
3. Verify action IS deferred.
4. Set `m_bInitializing = false`, flush.
5. Verify `PlayMedia` executes at flush time.

### T3 — Skin Without Startup.xml (No Regression Introduced)
1. Boot with default Estouchy skin (no `Startup.xml` window-nav).
2. Verify boot completes normally and deferred actions flush as before.

### T4 — `ActivateWindow` With Path Parameter During Boot
1. Fire `GUI_MSG_EXECUTE` with `"ActivateWindow(Home,/path)"`.
2. Verify not deferred.
3. Verify correct window + path activated.

## 8. Risk Assessment

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|--------|------------|
| Bootcritical prefix list incomplete | Low | High | Audit all `CBuiltins` window-navigation handlers; add any missing prefixes |
| Immediate execution crashes if window manager not ready | Low | Medium | Window manager is initialised before `Startup.xml` runs; safe |
| Fix interacts badly with R3 `DeferredAction` struct | None | None | R1 fix is independent; struct upgrade composes cleanly |
| Case-sensitivity of action strings | Low | Low | `StartsWithNoCase` handles all variations |

### Overall Risk
**Low.** The change adds a small allow-list bypass; all other deferral behaviour is unchanged. It directly restores the original boot contract.
