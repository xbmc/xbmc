# Regression 3 — CGUIListItemPtr Item Context Lost on Replay

**Repository:** OrganizerRo/xbmc  
**Date:** 2024  
**Severity:** Medium-High — silent behavioral regression; no crash, but wrong playback/navigation for item-bearing actions during early boot.

---

## 1. Root Cause Analysis

### The Deferral Bug

A PR added early-boot deferral logic to `CApplication::ExecuteXBMCAction` guarded by `m_bInitializing == true`. In the actual code, label resolution via `GetItemLabel`/`GetLabel` occurs **before** the deferral check — so the deferred queue stores the **already-resolved** action string, not the original template:

```cpp
// Application.cpp — actual code (BUGGY)
bool CApplication::ExecuteXBMCAction(std::string actionStr, const CGUIListItemPtr &item)
{
  const std::string in_actionStr(actionStr);   // ← original unresolved string saved here

  // BUG: resolution happens at boot time when GUI info context is not fully ready
  if (item)
    actionStr = GetItemLabel(actionStr, item.get());  // may return empty/wrong at boot
  else
    actionStr = GetLabel(actionStr);                  // resolves against boot-time context

  if (m_bInitializing) {
    m_deferredActions.push_back(actionStr);  // ← BUG: stores baked (possibly wrong) string;
    return true;                             //         in_actionStr and item both lost
  }
  // … rest of function
}

// Later, when m_bInitializing becomes false:
for (const auto& action : m_deferredActions)
  ExecuteXBMCAction(action, nullptr);  // re-runs GetLabel on already-baked string; item = nullptr
```

The two compounding bugs are:

1. **Resolution at boot time** — `GetItemLabel`/`GetLabel` are called while GUI info context (skin, window state, infoManager) may not be fully initialised, potentially returning empty or incorrect strings for `$INFO[ListItem.*]` tokens.
2. **Original string discarded** — `in_actionStr` (the raw unresolved template) is never stored; the partially-resolved string is baked into the queue, so correct re-resolution at replay time is impossible even when GUI context is fully ready.

### Why the Item and the Original String Both Matter

`ExecuteXBMCAction` resolves `$INFO[ListItem.*]` tokens at **Application.cpp:3984–3987** (before the deferral guard at 3990):

```cpp
const std::string in_actionStr(actionStr);   // original template
if (item)
  actionStr = GUILIB::GUIINFO::CGUIInfoLabel::GetItemLabel(actionStr, item.get());
else
  actionStr = GUILIB::GUIINFO::CGUIInfoLabel::GetLabel(actionStr);
// ← deferral check follows here at 3990
```

When `item` is present, `GetItemLabel` resolves `$INFO[ListItem.*]` tokens against the specific list item's properties (e.g., `ListItem.FileNameAndPath`, `ListItem.Property(node.target)`, PVR tags, artwork URLs). At boot time the GUI info manager may not yet be fully initialised, so `GetItemLabel` can return empty strings or wrong values for those tokens. The resulting partially-resolved string is then baked into `m_deferredActions` and replayed verbatim — there is no second chance to use the correct item context.

At replay (line 3770), `ExecuteXBMCAction(action, nullptr)` is called; `GetLabel(action)` is invoked again on the already-baked string. If no `$INFO[]` tokens remain, `GetLabel` returns the string unchanged — correct if the first resolution succeeded, silently wrong if it did not.

## 2. Exact Call Path from DirectoryProvider::OnClick to ExecuteXBMCAction with Item

### Path A — DirectoryProvider (item resolved before send, no item in message)

```
DirectoryProvider::OnClick(const CGUIListItemPtr &item)
  → fileItem = CFileItem copy of item              [DirectoryProvider.cpp:353]
  → target = fileItem.GetProperty("node.target")   [DirectoryProvider.cpp:360]
  → execute = GetFavouritesService().GetExecutePath(fileItem, target) [line 371]
  → CGUIMessage message(GUI_MSG_EXECUTE, 0, 0)     [line 374]
  → message.SetStringParam(execute)                [line 375]
  → WindowManager.SendMessage(message)             [line 376]
      → CApplication::OnMessage(message)
          → case GUI_MSG_EXECUTE:                  [Application.cpp:3956]
              ExecuteXBMCAction(
                message.GetStringParam(),          // execute string
                message.GetItem()                  // ← nullptr! item was NOT put in message
              )
```

**Note:** In this path `node.target` and `node.target_url` are already resolved _before_ the message is sent. The execute string is fully baked. However, if `execute` itself contains `$INFO[ListItem.*]` tokens (which can happen if the skin/favourites service uses them), item context is still needed.

### Path B — CGUIAction::ExecuteActions (item explicitly in message)

```
CGUIAction::ExecuteActions(controlID, parentID, item)
  → for each action string i:
      CGUIMessage msg(GUI_MSG_EXECUTE, controlID, parentID, 0, 0, item)  [GUIAction.cpp:41]
      msg.SetStringParam(i)                        [line 42]
      WindowManager.SendMessage(msg)               [line 45-46]
          → CApplication::OnMessage(message)
              → case GUI_MSG_EXECUTE:
                  ExecuteXBMCAction(
                    message.GetStringParam(),      // may contain $INFO[ListItem.*]
                    message.GetItem()              // ← item IS provided
                  )
```

This is the **primary regression path** — action strings like `PlayMedia($INFO[ListItem.FileNameAndPath])` or `ActivateWindow(MyVideoNav,$INFO[ListItem.Property(node.target_url)])` depend on item context for resolution at line 3972.

> **Current vs. fixed code order:** In the current (buggy) code, `GetItemLabel`/`GetLabel` runs *before* the `m_bInitializing` check, so the item is consumed but the resolved result may be empty/wrong during boot. The proposed fix moves the label resolution block to *after* the deferral check, so resolution only happens when `CGUIInfoManager` is fully initialised (at flush time and during normal execution).

---

## 3. What Item Properties Are Used After the Deferral Point

All property resolution happens at `Application.cpp:3971–3974`, **before** any command dispatch. The following item properties are thus affected by the deferral:

| Token/Property | Use Case |
|----------------|----------|
| `$INFO[ListItem.FileNameAndPath]` | `PlayMedia(...)` actions on media items |
| `$INFO[ListItem.Property(node.target)]` | Widget/skin navigation to custom window targets |
| `$INFO[ListItem.Property(node.target_url)]` | Directory/path navigation |
| `$INFO[ListItem.Property(Addon.ID)]` | Addon-specific actions |
| `$INFO[ListItem.PVRChannelNumber]` | PVR channel switch |
| `ListItem.Art(thumb)`, `ListItem.Art(fanart)` | Artwork-based commands |
| Custom playlist properties | Skin-injected playlist references |
| `$INFO[ListItem.Label]` | Label-based routing in skin XML |

Any action string that contains `$INFO[ListItem.*]` will silently produce wrong output when replayed without the item.

**The real regression with the current eager-resolution code:** During boot (`m_bInitializing == true`), `CGUIInfoManager` is not yet fully initialised. `GetItemLabel` and `GetLabel` may return empty strings or stale values for:
- Window or skin properties (`Window.Property(...)`, `Skin.String(...)`) — the window may not be fully loaded
- Player and PVR info tokens (`Player.HasMedia`, `ListItem.PVRChannelNumber`) — PVR/player managers not started
- Library metadata tokens — the database is not yet open

For item-level primitive properties (`CFileItem::GetPath()`, raw label, basic art) that are stored directly on the `CFileItem`, resolution may succeed. But for properties that require an active info manager query, they resolve to empty at deferral time.

At flush time the item is gone (the flush loop calls `ExecuteXBMCAction(action, nullptr)`), so the info manager — now fully initialised — cannot be asked to retry the resolution with the original item.

The fix stores `{original_actionStr, item}` pairs (the **unresolved** string plus the item pointer). At flush time `ExecuteXBMCAction(deferred.actionStr, deferred.item)` is called, triggering a fresh resolution when the info manager is ready and the item is still available via the stored `shared_ptr`.

---

## 4. Candidate Fix Approaches

### Approach A — Store `{original string, item}` Pairs (Recommended)

Change `m_deferredActions` from `std::deque<std::string>` to `std::deque<DeferredAction>` where each entry holds the **original unresolved** action string (`in_actionStr`) and the item pointer. On replay, call `ExecuteXBMCAction(deferred.actionStr, deferred.item)` — resolution then happens when GUI services are fully ready.

**Pros:**
- Minimal change; preserves all lazy-resolution semantics.
- Item lifetime is extended by `shared_ptr` ref-counting; no dangling pointer risk.
- Correct resolution context at replay time.

**Cons:**
- If the item's properties change between deferral and replay (e.g., a background update modifies the CFileItem), the resolved action may differ. This is acceptable — it matches the semantics of "the action the user intended".

---

### Approach B — Resolve Labels Eagerly at Deferral Time (current behaviour)

At the deferral point, immediately call `GetItemLabel` / `GetLabel` to resolve `$INFO[...]` tokens, then store the fully-resolved string. On replay, no item is needed. **This is already what the current code does** — the resolution block runs before the `m_bInitializing` check.

**Pros:**
- No item lifetime management.
- Simple: `m_deferredActions` stays `std::deque<std::string>`.

**Cons:**
- `CGUIInfoManager` is not fully initialised when `m_bInitializing == true`, causing `GetItemLabel` to return empty strings for most tokens.
- Loses true lazy-resolution; the resolved (empty/wrong) string is stored and re-executed at flush time.
- Does not fix the PVR tag / artwork cases that use item data not expressible as a label token.

---

### Approach C — Skip Deferral for Item-Bearing Actions

If `item != nullptr`, bypass the deferral and execute immediately even during `m_bInitializing`. The assumption is that any caller providing an item has already ensured sufficient context is available.

**Pros:**
- Zero change to deferral storage.
- Semantically clear: "I have enough context, run now."

**Cons:**
- Executing during initialisation may crash or produce undefined results if required services (e.g., PlaybackManager, PVRManager) are not ready.
- Partial deferral (some actions deferred, some not) introduces ordering hazards if actions are interdependent.
- Not safe for all item-bearing actions.

---

### Approach D — Store the Full CGUIMessage

Instead of `std::deque<std::string>`, keep a `std::deque<CGUIMessage>`. When deferring, push the full message. On replay, re-dispatch via `CApplication::OnMessage`.

**Pros:** Perfect fidelity — all message fields (senderID, controlID, params, item) are preserved.
Future-proof: any new fields added to GUI_MSG_EXECUTE are automatically preserved.

**Cons:**
- CGUIMessage is not cheaply copyable (vector of strings, shared_ptr).

**Pros:**
- Perfect fidelity — all message fields (senderID, controlID, params, item) are preserved.
- Future-proof: any new fields added to GUI_MSG_EXECUTE are automatically preserved.

**Cons:**
- CGUIMessage is not cheaply copyable (vector of strings, shared_ptr).
- Re-dispatching through OnMessage may trigger unintended side-effects if other message handling code has changed state between deferral and replay.
- Slightly over-engineered for this specific bug.

---

## 5. Recommended Fix — Approach A: Store `{string, item}` Pairs

Approach A is the correct surgical fix. It preserves all existing semantics, is safe with `shared_ptr` lifetime management, and requires changes in only two places.

### Detailed Code Changes

#### `xbmc/Application.h`

**1. Add the deferred action type and member:**

```cpp
// Before (actual code):
std::deque<std::string> m_deferredActions;

// After (FIXED):
// In the private section, near m_bInitializing:
struct DeferredAction
{
  std::string actionStr;   // original unresolved string (in_actionStr, not post-GetItemLabel)
  CGUIListItemPtr item;
};
std::deque<DeferredAction> m_deferredActions;
```

#### `xbmc/Application.cpp`

**2. Move the deferral check to before label resolution, and store the unresolved string + item:**

```cpp
// Before (actual code — BUGGY):
bool CApplication::ExecuteXBMCAction(std::string actionStr, const CGUIListItemPtr &item)
{
  const std::string in_actionStr(actionStr);
  if (item)
    actionStr = GetItemLabel(actionStr, item.get());  // ← resolves at boot (context not ready)
  else
    actionStr = GetLabel(actionStr);

  if (m_bInitializing) {
    m_deferredActions.push_back(actionStr);   // ← stores baked string; in_actionStr and item lost
    return true;
  }
  // ...
}

// After (FIXED):
bool CApplication::ExecuteXBMCAction(std::string actionStr, const CGUIListItemPtr &item)
{
  const std::string in_actionStr(actionStr);

  if (m_bInitializing) {
    // Store original string + item; resolution deferred to flush time when GUI context is ready.
    m_deferredActions.push_back({in_actionStr, item});
    return true;
  }

  // Resolution now only happens for immediate (non-deferred) execution:
  if (item)
    actionStr = GetItemLabel(actionStr, item.get());
  else
    actionStr = GetLabel(actionStr);
  // ...
}
```

**Note:** The fix also **moves the label resolution block** to after the deferral check — ensuring resolution only runs when `CGUIInfoManager` is fully initialised.

**3. Change the replay loop (wherever deferred actions are flushed):**

```cpp
// Before (BUGGY):
for (const auto& action : m_deferredActions)
  ExecuteXBMCAction(action);
m_deferredActions.clear();

// After (FIXED):
for (const auto& deferred : m_deferredActions)
  ExecuteXBMCAction(deferred.actionStr, deferred.item);
m_deferredActions.clear();
```

## 7. Edge Cases

### 7a. Item Is a Plugin Item (`plugin://`)
- Plugin items carry their resolved plugin URL in `GetPath()`.
- With the current (buggy) eager resolution, `GetItemLabel` is called at deferral time during boot when `CGUIInfoManager` may not be ready, potentially returning empty.
- With the fix, resolution is deferred: `GetItemLabel` is called at flush time when the info manager is fully initialised and the item's `GetPath()` resolves correctly to `plugin://...`.
- Without the fix, `GetLabel()` at flush time would return the _focused_ item's path or empty, silently playing/navigating to the wrong plugin.

### 7b. Item Has PVR Tags
- PVR items store channel, recording, EPG, and timer tags.
- With the current (buggy) eager resolution at boot time, PVR info tokens like `$INFO[ListItem.PVRChannelName]` may return empty because PVR managers are not yet started.
- With the fix, resolution is deferred to flush time when both the PVR manager is up **and** the original PVR item is available via the stored `shared_ptr`.
- Without the fix, any PVR property that goes through the info manager resolves to empty at deferral time and remains wrong at flush time (since the item is also gone).

### 7c. Item Has Custom `node.target` / `node.target_url`
- `DirectoryProvider::OnClick` reads these at click time and bakes them into the `execute` string via `GetExecutePath`.  
- For this specific path, the item properties are already consumed before the `GUI_MSG_EXECUTE` is sent — the message item is `nullptr`.  
- **Not directly affected** by the deferral regression, but tests should confirm `GetExecutePath` always returns a fully-resolved, item-free string.

### 7d. Item Is `nullptr` from the Caller
- `ExecuteXBMCAction` already handles `item == nullptr` correctly at lines 3971–3974.  
- Deferred storage of a null `item` is safe; replay is identical to the original call.

### 7e. Item Is Deleted Before Replay
- `CGUIListItemPtr` is `std::shared_ptr<CGUIListItem>`. Storing a copy of the `shared_ptr` in `DeferredAction` extends the item's lifetime until the deferred list is flushed.  
- No dangling pointer risk.

### 7f. Long Deferral Window (Very Slow Boot)
- If boot takes longer than expected (e.g., slow network mount, large library scan), the item's properties reflect the state at click time, not at replay time. This is the **correct** behavior — the user clicked on _that_ item.

### 7g. Multiple Deferred Actions for the Same Item
- Each `DeferredAction` holds an independent `shared_ptr` copy. Multiple deferred actions against the same item are safe; each holds its own ref.

---

## 8. Test Scenarios

### T1 — Basic Deferral with Item (CGUIAction path)
1. Force `m_bInitializing = true`.  
2. Construct a `CGUIListItemPtr` with `FileNameAndPath = "smb://server/movie.mkv"`.  
3. Send `GUI_MSG_EXECUTE` with action `"PlayMedia($INFO[ListItem.FileNameAndPath])"` and the item.  
4. Verify action is deferred (not executed immediately).  
5. Set `m_bInitializing = false` and trigger the flush.  
6. Verify `PlayMedia("smb://server/movie.mkv")` is called.  
**Expected (fixed):** Correct path played.  
**Bug behavior:** `GetLabel("PlayMedia($INFO[ListItem.FileNameAndPath])")` resolves against focused item or returns empty → wrong/no playback.

### T2 — Deferral with nullptr Item
1. Send `GUI_MSG_EXECUTE` with a plain action string like `"ActivateWindow(Home)"` and no item.  
2. Defer and replay.  
3. Verify window activation fires correctly.  
**Expected:** No regression; null item path unchanged.

### T3 — DirectoryProvider::OnClick During Boot
1. Simulate OnClick with a CFileItem that has `node.target = "MyVideoNav"` and a custom URL.  
2. Verify the `execute` string from `GetExecutePath` is fully resolved.  
3. Defer and replay.  
4. Verify the navigation target is correct (no item needed at replay since string is pre-baked).

### T4 — PVR Channel Action During Boot
1. Create a PVR CFileItem with a specific channel.  
2. Send `GUI_MSG_EXECUTE` with action `"PlayPVRChannelOnLastActivePlayer($INFO[ListItem.Label])"` and the item.  
3. Defer.  
4. Change focused GUI item to a different channel.  
5. Flush deferred actions.  
6. Verify the _original_ channel is played, not the currently focused one.

### T5 — Plugin Item Action
1. Plugin CFileItem with path `"plugin://video.plugin/?action=play&id=123"`.  
2. Action: `"PlayMedia($INFO[ListItem.FileNameAndPath])"`.  
3. Defer and replay.  
4. Verify plugin URL `plugin://video.plugin/?action=play&id=123` is dispatched.

### T6 — Item Freed Between Deferral and Replay
1. Create a `CFileItemPtr`, send a deferred action with it.  
2. Release the original `CFileItemPtr` in the caller.  
3. Trigger replay.  
4. Verify the action executes correctly (shared_ptr in `DeferredAction` still holds the item).

## 9. Risk Assessment

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|--------|------------|
| Stored item mutated between defer and replay | Low | Medium | `shared_ptr` copies share state; if caller modifies the underlying CFileItem, replay uses modified state. Acceptable — reflects reality. |
| Increased memory usage during boot | Low | Low | Only items clicked during `m_bInitializing` window are retained. Boot is fast; few items deferred in practice. |
| `CGUIListItemPtr` not thread-safe to access from replay thread | Medium | High | Ensure replay always happens on the GUI thread (same thread as original defer). If the flush loop runs on a non-GUI thread, add a guard. |
| Ordering of deferred actions | Low | Medium | `std::deque` preserves insertion order; FIFO replay is correct. |
| Approach C (skip deferral for item-bearing actions) causes crash if services not ready | High (if chosen) | High | Approach A avoids this entirely by always deferring and replaying in order. |
| `DeferredAction` struct ABI break if other TUs cache the type | None | None | `DeferredAction` is private to `CApplication`. |
| Pre-baked strings in DirectoryProvider already correct | Verified | None | Node.target and node.target_url are resolved before `GUI_MSG_EXECUTE`; no item needed at replay for that path. |

### Overall Risk of the Fix (Approach A)
**Low.** The change is surgical: the label resolution block is moved below the deferral check in `.cpp`, and one struct + one field change in `.h`. The deferral push stores `{actionStr, item}` instead of a resolved string. No new threading, no new lifetime management beyond what `shared_ptr` already provides. The fix restores the original contract: "replay an action exactly as if the user had clicked during normal operation."
