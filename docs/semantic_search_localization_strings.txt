Semantic Search Localization Strings
=====================================

These localization strings need to be added to Kodi's language files in the 39500-39599 range.

String IDs and Definitions:
----------------------------

# Category and Group Labels
39500: "Semantic Search"
39501: "General"
39510: "Transcription"
39520: "Indexing"

# General Settings
39502: "Enable semantic search"
39503: "Enable content indexing for semantic search. This allows you to search your media library using natural language queries."
39504: "Processing mode"
39505: "When idle"
39506: "Background"
39507: "Manual only"
39509: "Choose when to process and index media content"

# Transcription Settings

39513: "Auto-transcribe media"
39514: "Automatically transcribe media files that don't have subtitles using Groq Whisper"

# Indexing Settings

39523: "Index metadata"
39524: "Include movie/TV show metadata (titles, descriptions, cast) in semantic search index"

Notes:
------
- These strings follow Kodi's existing localization patterns
- String IDs 39500-39524 are allocated (25 strings used out of 100 available in the range)
- Remaining IDs (39525-39599) are reserved for future semantic search features
- Help text (39503, 39509, 39512, 39514, 39516, 39522, 39524) provides detailed user guidance

Integration Points:
-------------------
- Settings XML: /home/user/xbmc/system/settings/settings.xml (lines 1692-1756)
- Settings constants: /home/user/xbmc/xbmc/settings/Settings.h (lines 68-74)
- To add these to Kodi's localization system, they need to be added to the appropriate
  language resource files following Kodi's localization workflow
